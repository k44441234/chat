          "The nervous system is unique in the vast complexity of thought processes and control actions that it can perform. Each minute it receives literally millions of bits of informa- tion from the different sensory nerves and sensory organs and then integrates all these to determine responses to be made by the body.",

          "The central nervous system is estimated to contain 80 to 100 billion neurons. Figure 46-1 shows a typical neuron of a type found in the brain motor cortex. Incoming signals enter this neuron through synapses located mostly on the neuronal dendrites, but also on the cell body. For different types of neurons, there may be only a few hundred or as many as 200,000 such synaptic connections from input fibers. In contrast, the output signal travels via a single axon leaving the neuron. Then, this axon may have many separate branches to other parts of the nervous system or peripheral body.",
          "A special feature of most synapses is that the signal normally passes only in the forward direction, from the axon of a preceding neuron to dendrites on cell mem- branes of subsequent neurons. This feature forces the signal to travel in required directions to perform specific nervous functions."

These sensory experiences can either cause immediate reactions from the brain, or memories of the experiences can be stored in the brain for minutes, weeks, or years and determine bodily reactions at some future date.",
          "Figure 46-2 shows the somatic portion of the sen- sory system, which transmits sensory information from the receptors of the entire body surface and from some deep structures. This information enters the central nervous system through peripheral nerves and is con- ducted immediately to multiple sensory areas in (1) the spinal cord at all levels; (2) the reticular substance of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon of the brain; (3) the cerebellum; (4) the thalamus; and (5) areas of the cerebral cortex."

          "The most important eventual role of the nervous sys- tem is to control the various bodily activities. This task is achieved by controlling (1) contraction of appropriate skeletal muscles throughout the body; (2) contraction of smooth muscle in the internal organs; and (3) secretion of active chemical substances by both exocrine and endo- crine glands in many parts of the body. These activities are collectively called motor functions of the nervous system, and the muscles and glands are called effectors because they are the actual anatomical structures that perform the functions dictated by the nerve signals.",
          "Figure 46-3 shows the “skeletal” motor nerve axis of the nervous system for controlling skeletal muscle con- traction. Operating parallel to this axis is another sys- tem, called the autonomic nervous system, for controlling smooth muscles, glands, and other internal bodily sys- tems; this system is discussed in Chapter 61.",
          "Note in Figure 46-3 that the skeletal muscles can be controlled from many levels of the central nervous sys- tem, including (1) the spinal cord; (2) the reticular sub- stance of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon; (3) the basal ganglia; (4) the cerebellum; and (5) the motor cortex. Each of these areas has its own specific role. The lower regions are concerned primarily with automatic, instantaneous muscle responses to sensory stimuli, and the higher regions are concerned with deliberate complex muscle movements controlled by thought processes of the brain."

        "paragraphs": [
          "One of the most important functions of the nervous sys- tem is to process incoming information in such a way that appropriate mental and motor responses will occur. More than 99% of all sensory information is discarded by the brain as irrelevant and unimportant. For example, one is ordinarily unaware of the parts of the body that are in con- tact with clothing, as well as the seat pressure when sitting. Likewise, attention is drawn only to an occasional object in one’s field of vision, and even the perpetual noise of our surroundings is usually relegated to the subconscious.",
          "However, when important sensory information excites the mind, it is immediately channeled into proper inte- grative and motor regions of the brain to cause desired responses. This channeling and processing of information is called the integrative function of the nervous system. Thus, if a person places a hand on a hot stove, the desired instantaneous response is to lift the hand. Other associ- ated responses follow, such as moving the entire body away from the stove and perhaps even shouting with pain."

          "The synapse is the junction point from one neuron to the next. Later in this chapter, we discuss the details of syn- aptic function. However, it is important to note here that synapses determine the directions that the nervous sig- nals will spread through the nervous system. Some syn- apses transmit signals from one neuron to the next with ease, whereas others transmit signals only with difficulty. Also, facilitatory and inhibitory signals from other areas in the nervous system can control synaptic transmission, sometimes opening the synapses for transmission and, at other times, closing them. In addition, some postsynaptic neurons respond with large numbers of output impulses, and others respond with only a few. Thus, the synapses perform a selective action, often blocking weak signals while allowing strong signals to pass but, at other times, selecting and amplifying certain weak signals and often channeling these signals in many directions rather than in only one direction."

However, much of the information is stored for future control of motor activities and for use in the thinking processes. Most storage occurs in the cerebral cortex, but even the basal regions of the brain and the spinal cord can store small amounts of information.",
          "The storage of information is the process we call mem- ory, which is also a function of the synapses. Each time certain types of sensory signals pass through sequences of synapses, these synapses become more capable of trans- mitting the same type of signal the next time, a process called facilitation. After the sensory signals have passed through the synapses a large number of times, the syn- apses become so facilitated that signals generated within the brain itself can also cause transmission of impulses through the same sequences of synapses, even when the sensory input is not excited. This process gives the person a perception of experiencing the original sensa- tions, although the perceptions are only memories of the sensations.",
          "The precise mechanisms whereby long-term facilita- tion of synapses occurs in the memory process are still uncertain, but what is known about this and other details of the sensory memory process are discussed in Chapter 58.",
          "Once memories have been stored in the nervous sys- tem, they become part of the brain processing mechanism for future “thinking” That is, the thinking processes of the brain compare new sensory experiences with stored memories; the memories then help select the important new sensory information and channel this into appropri- ate memory storage areas for future use or into motor areas to cause immediate bodily responses."

This supposition is far from the truth. Even after the spi- nal cord has been cut in the high neck region, many highly organized spinal cord functions still occur. For example, neuronal circuits in the cord can cause (1) walking move- ments; (2) reflexes that withdraw portions of the body away from painful objects; (3) reflexes that stiffen the legs to support the body against gravity; and (4) reflexes that control local blood vessels, gastrointestinal movements, or urinary excretion. In fact, the upper levels of the ner- vous system often operate not by sending signals directly to the periphery of the body, but by sending signals to the control centers of the cord, simply “commanding” the cord centers to perform their functions."

For example, subconscious control of arterial pressure and respiration is achieved mainly in the medulla and pons. Control of equilibrium is a combined function of the older portions of the cerebellum and the reticular sub- stance of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon. Feeding reflexes, such as salivation and licking the lips in response to the taste of food, are controlled by areas in the medulla, pons, mesencephalon, amygdala, and hypothalamus.

The cortex never functions alone but always in association with lower centers of the ner- vous system.",
          "Without the cerebral cortex, the functions of the lower brain centers are often imprecise. The vast storehouse of cortical information usually converts these functions to determinative and precise operations.",
          "Finally, the cerebral cortex is essential for most of our thought processes, but it cannot function by itself. In fact, it is the lower brain centers, not the cortex, that initiate wakefulness in the cerebral cortex, thereby opening its bank of memories to the thinking machinery of the brain. Thus, each portion of the nervous system performs spe- cific functions, but it is the cortex that opens a world of stored information for use by the mind."

          "In simple computers, the output signals are con- trolled directly by the input signals, operating in a man- ner similar to that of simple reflexes of the spinal cord. In more complex computers, the output is determined by input signals and by information that has already been stored in memory in the computer, which is analogous to the more complex reflex and processing mechanisms of the human higher nervous system. Furthermore, as computers become even more complex, it is necessary to add still another unit, called the central processing unit, which determines the sequence of all operations. This unit is analogous to the control mechanisms in the brain that direct a person’s attention first to one thought or sensation or motor activity, then to another, and so forth, until complex sequences of thought or action take place.",

          "Most of the synapses used for signal transmission in the central nervous system of the human being are chemi- cal synapses. In these synapses, the first neuron secretes at its nerve ending synapse a chemical substance called a neurotransmitter (often called a transmitter substance), and this transmitter in turn acts on receptor proteins in the membrane of the next neuron to excite the neuron, inhibit it, or modify its sensitivity in some other way (Video 46-1). More than 50 important neurotransmitters have been discovered thus far. Some of the best known are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, serotonin, and glutamate.",
          "In electrical synapses, the cytoplasms of adjacent cells are directly connected by clusters of ion channels called gap junctions that allow free movement of ions from the interior of one cell to the interior of the next cell. Such junctions were discussed in Chapter 4, and it is by way of gap junctions and other similar junctions that action potentials are transmitted from one smooth muscle fiber to the next in visceral smooth muscle (Chapter 8) and from one cardiac muscle cell to the next in cardiac muscle (Chapter 9).",
          "Although most synapses in the brain are chemical, electrical and chemical synapses may coexist and interact in the central nervous system. The bidirectional transmis- sion of electrical synapses permits them to help coordinate the activities of large groups of interconnected neurons. For example, electrical synapses are useful in detecting the coincidence of simultaneous subthreshold depolar- izations within a group of interconnected neurons; this enables increased neuronal sensitivity and promotes syn- chronous firing of a group of interconnected neurons.",

This characteristic is that they always transmit the signals in one direction—that is, from the neuron that secretes the neurotransmitter, called the presynaptic neuron, to the neuron on which the transmit- ter acts, called the postsynaptic neuron. This phenomenon is the principle of one-way conduction at chemical synaps- es, and it is different from conduction through electrical synapses, which often transmit signals in either direction.",
          "A one-way conduction mechanism allows signals to be directed toward specific goals. Indeed, it is this spe- cific transmission of signals to discrete and highly focused areas both within the nervous system and at the terminals of the peripheral nerves that allows the nervous system to perform its myriad functions of sensation, motor control, memory, and many other functions."

It is composed of three major parts—the soma, which is the main body of the neuron, a single axon, which extends from the soma into a peripheral nerve that leaves the spinal cord, and den- drites, which are great numbers of branching projections of the soma that extend as much as 1 millimeter into the surrounding areas of the cord.",
          "As many as 10,000 to 200,000 minute synaptic knobs called presynaptic terminals lie on the surfaces of the den- drites and soma of the motor neuron, with about 80% to 95% of them on the dendrites and only 5% to 20% on the soma. These presynaptic terminals are the ends of nerve fibrils that originate from many other neurons. Many of these presynaptic terminals are excitatory—that is, they secrete a neurotransmitter that excites the postsynaptic neuron. However, other presynaptic terminals are inhibi- tory—that is, they secrete a neurotransmitter that inhibits the postsynaptic neuron.",

These differences make neurons in various parts of the nervous system react differently to incoming synaptic signals and, therefore, perform many different functions.",
          "Presynaptic Terminals. Electron microscopic studies of the presynaptic terminals show that they have varied ana- tomical forms, but most of them resemble small round or oval knobs and therefore are sometimes called terminal knobs, boutons, end-feet, or synaptic knobs.",
          "Figure 46-5A illustrates the basic structure of a chemi- cal synapse, showing a single presynaptic terminal on the membrane surface of a postsynaptic neuron. The presyn- aptic terminal is separated from the postsynaptic neuro- nal soma by a synaptic cleft usually 200 to 300 angstroms (A) wide. The terminal has two internal structures impor- tant to the excitatory or inhibitory function of the syn- apse: the transmitter vesicles and the mitochondria. The transmitter vesicles contain the neurotransmitter that when released into the synaptic cleft, excites or inhibits the postsynaptic neuron. It excites the postsynaptic neu- ron if the neuronal membrane contains excitatory recep- tors, and it inhibits the neuron if the membrane contains inhibitory receptors. The mitochondria provide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which in turn supplies the energy for synthesizing new transmitter substances.",
          "When an action potential spreads over a presynaptic terminal, depolarization of its membrane causes a small number of vesicles to empty into the cleft. The released transmitter in turn binds to a receptor on the postsynap- tic neuronal membrane, causing an immediate change in its permeability characteristics and leading to excitation or inhibition of the postsynaptic neuron, depending on the neuronal receptor characteristics."

          "The membrane of the presynaptic terminal is called the presynaptic membrane. It contains large numbers of voltage-gated calcium channels. When an action potential depolarizes the presynaptic membrane, these calcium channels open and allow large numbers of calcium ions to flow into the terminal (Figure 46-5A). The quantity of neurotransmitter that is then released from the terminal into the synaptic cleft is directly related to the number of calcium ions that enter (Video 46-2). The precise mecha- nism whereby the calcium ions cause this release is not known, but it is believed to be the following.",
          "When the calcium ions enter the presynaptic termi- nal, they bind with special protein molecules on the inside surface of the presynaptic membrane, called release sites. This binding in turn causes the release sites to open through the membrane, allowing a few transmitter ves- icles to release their transmitter into the cleft after each single action potential. For the vesicles that store the neu- rotransmitter acetylcholine, between 2,000 and 10,000 molecules of acetylcholine are present in each vesicle, and there are enough vesicles in the presynaptic terminal to transmit from a few hundred to more than 10,000 action potentials."

The molecules of these receptors have two important components: (1) a binding component that protrudes out- ward from the membrane into the synaptic cleft, where it binds the neurotransmitter coming from the presynaptic terminal; and (2) an intracellular component that passes all the way through the postsynaptic membrane to the interior of the postsynaptic neuron.",
          "Receptor activation controls the opening of ion chan- nels in the postsynaptic cell in one of two ways: (1) by gat- ing ion channels directly and allowing passage of specified types of ions through the membrane; or (2) by activating a “second messenger” that is not an ion channel but, instead, is a molecule that protrudes into the cell cytoplasm and activates one or more substances inside the postsynaptic neuron. These second messengers increase or decrease specific cellular functions.",
          "Neurotransmitter receptors that directly gate ion channels are often called ionotropic receptors, whereas those that act through second messenger systems are called metabotropic receptors.",
          "lon Channels. The ion channels in the postsynaptic neuronal membrane are usually of two types: (1) cation channels, which usually allow sodium ions to pass when opened but sometimes also allow potassium and/or cal- cium ions to pass; and (2) anion channels, which mainly allow chloride ions to pass but also allow minute quanti- ties of other anions to pass. As discussed in Chapter 4, these ion channels are highly selective for transport of one or more specific ions. This selectivity depends on its diameter, shape, and the electrical charges and chemical bonds along its inside surfaces.",
          "The cation channels that conduct sodium ions are lined with negative charges. These charges attract the positively charged sodium ions into the channel when the channel diameter increases to a size larger than that of the hydrated sodium ion. However, these same negative charges repel chloride ions and other anions and prevent their passage.",
          "For the anion channels, when the channel diam- eters become large enough, chloride ions pass into the channels and on through to the opposite side, whereas sodium, potassium, and calcium cations are blocked, mainly because their hydrated ions are too large to pass.",
          "We will learn later that when cation channels open and allow positively charged sodium ions to enter, the positive electrical charges of the sodium ions will in turn excite this neuron. Therefore, a neurotransmitter that opens cation channels is called an excitatory transmitter. Con- versely, opening anion channels allows negative electrical charges to enter, which inhibits the neuron. Therefore, neurotransmitters that open these channels are called inhibitory transmitters.",
          "When a neurotransmitter activates an ion channel, the channel usually opens within a fraction of a millisecond; when the transmitter substance is no longer present, the channel closes equally rapidly. The opening and closing of ion channels provide a means for very rapid control of postsynaptic neurons.",
          "“Second Messenger” System in the Postsynaptic Neuron. Many functions of the nervous system—for example, the process of memory—require prolonged changes in neurons for seconds to months after the ini- tial transmitter substance is gone. The ion channels are not suitable for causing prolonged postsynaptic neuronal changes because these channels close within milliseconds after the transmitter substance is no longer present. How- ever, in many cases, prolonged postsynaptic neuronal ex- citation or inhibition is achieved by activating a second messenger chemical system inside the postsynaptic neu- ronal cell, and then it is the second messenger that causes the prolonged effect.",
          "There are several types of second messenger systems. One of the most common types uses a group of proteins called G proteins. Figure 46-7 shows a membrane recep- tor G protein. The inactive G protein complex is free in the cytosol and consists of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) plus three components: an alpha (a) component that is the activator portion of the G protein, and beta (§) and gamma (y) components that are attached to the alpha component. As long as the G protein complex is bound to GDP, it remains inactive.",
          "When the receptor is activated by a neurotransmit- ter, following a nerve impulse, the receptor undergoes a conformational change, exposing a binding site for the G protein complex, which then binds to the portion of the receptor that protrudes into the interior of the cell. This process permits the a subunit to release GDP and simultaneously bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) while separating from the B and y portions of the complex. The separated a-GTP complex is then free to move within the cytoplasm of the cell and perform one or more of sev- eral functions, depending on the specific characteristic of each type of neuron. The following four changes that can occur are shown in Figure 46-7: 1. Opening specific ion channels through the postsyn- aptic cell membrane. Shown in the upper right of the figure is a potassium channel that is opened in response to the G protein; this channel often stays open for a prolonged time, in contrast to rapid clo- sure of directly activated ion channels that do not use the second messenger system. 2. Activation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the neuronal cell. Recall that cAMP or cGMP can activate highly specific metabolic machinery in the neuron and, therefore, can initiate any one of many chemical results, including long-term changes in cell structure itself, which in turn alters long-term excitability of the neuron. 3. Activation of one or more intracellular enzymes. The G protein can directly activate one or more intracel- lular enzymes. In turn, the enzymes can cause many specific chemical functions in the cell. 4. Activation of gene transcription. Activation of gene transcription is one of the most important effects of activation of the second messenger systems because gene transcription can cause formation of new pro- teins within the neuron, thereby changing its meta- bolic machinery or its structure. It is well known that structural changes of appropriately activated neurons do occur, especially in long-term memory processes.",
          "Inactivation of the G protein occurs when the GTP bound to the a subunit is hydrolyzed to GDP. This action causes the a subunit to release from its target protein, thereby inactivating the second messenger systems, and then to combine again with the B and y subunits, return- ing the G protein complex to its inactive state.",
          "It is clear that activation of second messenger sys- tems within the neuron, whether of the G protein type or of other types, is extremely important for changing the long-term response characteristics of different neuronal pathways. We will return to this subject in more detail in Chapter 58 when we discuss memory functions of the nervous system."

The importance of having inhibitory and excitatory types of receptors is that this feature gives an additional dimen- sion to nervous function, allowing restraint of nervous action and excitation. The different molecular and membrane mechanisms used by the different receptors to cause excitation or inhi- bition include the following. Excitation: 1. Opening of sodium channels to allow large numbers of positive electrical charges to flow to the interior of the postsynaptic cell. This action raises the intracel- lular membrane potential in the positive direction up toward the threshold level for excitation. It is the most widely used means for causing excitation. 2. Depressed conduction through chloride or potassium channels or both. This action decreases the diffusion of negatively charged chloride ions to the inside of the postsynaptic neuron or decreases the diffusion of positively charged potassium ions to the outside. In either case, the effect is to make the internal membrane potential more positive than normal, which is excitatory. 3. Various changes in the internal metabolism of the postsynaptic neuron to excite cell activity or, in some cases, to increase the number of excitatory mem- brane receptors or decrease the number of inhibi- tory membrane receptors. Inhibition: 1. Opening of chloride ion channels through the post- synaptic neuronal membrane. This action allows rapid diffusion of negatively charged chloride ions from outside the postsynaptic neuron to the inside, thereby carrying negative charges inward and in- creasing the negativity inside, which is inhibitory. 2. Increase in conductance of potassium ions out of the neuron. This action allows positive ions to diffuse to the exterior, which causes increased negativity in- side the neuron; this is inhibitory. 3. Activation of receptor enzymes. This inhibits cellular metabolic functions and increases the number of inhibitory synaptic receptors or decreases the num- ber of excitatory receptors."

          "In most cases, the small-molecule types of transmitters are synthesized in the cytosol of the presynaptic termi- nal and are absorbed via active transport into the many transmitter vesicles in the terminal. Then, each time an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, a few vesicles at a time release their transmitter into the synaptic cleft. This action usually occurs within a mil- lisecond or less by the mechanism described earlier. The subsequent action of the small-molecule transmitter on the membrane receptors of the postsynaptic neuron usually also occurs within another millisecond or less. Most often, the effect is to increase or decrease conduc- tance through ion channels; an example is to increase sodium conductance, which causes excitation, or to increase potassium or chloride conductance, which causes inhibition.",
          "Recycling of Small-Molecule Types of Vesicles. Vesi- cles that store and release small-molecule transmitters are continually recycled and used over and over again. After they fuse with the synaptic membrane and open to release their transmitters, the vesicle membrane at first simply becomes part of the synaptic membrane. However, within seconds to minutes, the vesicle portion of the membrane invaginates back to the inside of the presynaptic terminal and pinches off to form a new vesicle. The new vesicular membrane still contains appropriate enzyme proteins or transport proteins required for synthesizing and/or con- centrating new transmitter substances inside the vesicle.",
          "Acetylcholine is a typical small-molecule transmitter that obeys the principles of synthesis and release, as stated earlier. This transmitter substance is synthesized in the presynaptic terminal from acetyl coenzyme A and choline in the presence of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. It is then transported into its specific vesicles. When the vesicles later release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft during synaptic neuronal signal transmission, the acetyl- choline is rapidly split again to acetate and choline by the enzyme cholinesterase, which is present in the proteo- glycan reticulum that fills the space of the synaptic cleft. Then, once again, inside the presynaptic terminal, the vesicles are recycled, and choline is actively transported back into the terminal to be used again for synthesis of new acetylcholine.",
          "Characteristics of Some Important Small-Molecule Transmitters. Acetylcholine is secreted by neurons in many areas of the nervous system but specifically by (1) the terminals of the large pyramidal cells from the mo- tor cortex; (2) several different types of neurons in the basal ganglia; (3) motor neurons that innervate the skel- etal muscles; (4) preganglionic neurons of the autonomic nervous system; (5) postganglionic neurons of the para- sympathetic nervous system; and (6) some of the post- ganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system. In most cases, acetylcholine has an excitatory effect; how- ever, it is known to have inhibitory effects at some periph- eral parasympathetic nerve endings, such as inhibition of the heart by the vagus nerves.",
          "Norepinephrine is secreted by the terminals of many neurons whose cell bodies are located in the brain stem and hypothalamus. Specifically, norepinephrine-secreting neurons located in the locus ceruleus in the pons send nerve fibers to widespread areas of the brain to help control overall activity and mood of the mind, such as increasing the level of wakefulness. In most of these areas, norepinephrine probably activates excitatory receptors, but in a few areas, it activates inhibitory receptors instead. Norepinephrine is also secreted by most postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, where it excites some organs but inhibits others.",

It is the primary inhibi- tory neurotransmitter in the adult central nervous system. Yet, in the early stages of brain development, including the embryonic period and first week of postnatal life, GABA is thought to serve as an excitatory neurotransmitter.",

          "Serotonin is secreted by nuclei that originate in the median raphe of the brain stem and project to many brain and spinal cord areas, especially to the dorsal horns of the spinal cord and the hypothalamus. Serotonin acts as an inhibitor of pain pathways in the cord; an inhibitor action in the higher regions of the nervous system is believed to help control the mood of the person, perhaps even to cause sleep.",
          "Nitric oxide is produced by nerve terminals in areas of the brain responsible for long-term behavior and memory. Therefore, this gaseous transmitter might in the future explain some behavior and memory functions that thus far have defied understanding. Nitric oxide is different from other small-molecule transmitters in its mechanism of formation in the presynaptic terminal and in its actions on the postsynaptic neuron. It is not pre- formed and stored in vesicles in the presynaptic terminal, as are other transmitters. Instead, it is synthesized almost instantly as needed and then diffuses out of the presynap- tic terminals over a period of seconds rather than being released in vesicular packets. Next, it diffuses into post- synaptic neurons nearby. In the postsynaptic neuron, it usually does not alter the membrane potential greatly but instead changes intracellular metabolic functions that modify neuronal excitability for seconds, minutes, or per- haps even longer."

The neuropeptides are not synthesized in the cytosol of the presynaptic terminals. Instead, they are synthesized as integral parts of large-protein molecules by ribosomes in the neuronal cell body.",
          "The protein molecules then enter the spaces inside the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell body and subsequently inside the Golgi apparatus, where two changes occur. First, the neuropeptide-forming protein is enzymatically split into smaller fragments, some of which are either the neuropeptide itself or a precursor of it. Second, the Golgi apparatus packages the neuropeptide into minute trans- mitter vesicles that are released into the cytoplasm. Then, the transmitter vesicles are transported all the way to the tips of the nerve fibers by axonal streaming of the axon cytoplasm, traveling at the slow rate of only a few centi- meters per day. Finally, these vesicles release their trans- mitter at the neuronal terminals in response to action potentials in the same manner as for small-molecule transmitters. However, the vesicle is autolyzed and is not reused.",
          "Because of this laborious method of forming the neu- ropeptides, much smaller quantities of neuropeptides than the small-molecule transmitters are usually released. This difference is partly compensated for by the fact that the neuropeptides are generally a thousand or more times as potent as the small-molecule transmitters. Another important characteristic of the neuropeptides is that they often cause much more prolonged actions. Some of these actions include prolonged closure of calcium channels, prolonged changes in the metabolic machinery of cells, prolonged changes in activation or deactivation of spe- cific genes in the cell nucleus, and/or prolonged altera- tions in numbers of excitatory or inhibitory receptors. Some of these effects last for days, but others last perhaps for months or years. Our knowledge of the functions of the neuropeptides is only beginning to develop.",
          "Neuropeptide and Small-Molecule Transmitters May Coexist in the Same Neurons. Slowly acting neuro- peptide transmitters and rapidly acting, small-molecule transmitters are often stored and released from the same neurons. In some cases, two or more of these transmit- ters are co-localized in the same synaptic vesicles and are co-released when an action potential reaches the pr- esynaptic terminal (Figure 46-8A). In other cases, these transmitters may be localized in different populations of synaptic vesicles of the same neuron and contribute to co- transmission of signals to a postsynaptic neuron. Moreo- ver, their release may be differentially regulated because of different calcium ion sensitivities (Figure 46-8B) or spatial segregation of the vesicles on different boutons (Figure 46-8C).",
          "The co-release of transmitters and co-transmission of signals obviously has important functional implications. Each different transmitter released from the same pre- synaptic neuron has its own specific receptors and may have inhibitory or excitatory influences on the postsyn- aptic target. Different neurons may release different com- binations of fast-acting transmitters that directly activate postsynaptic receptors, as well as slow-acting transmit- ters that require activation of second messenger cascades and postsynaptic changes in gene expression.",
          "An example of co-release of two small molecule trans- mitters is found in the raphe nucleus, located in the brain stem. These neurons provide innervation to several brain regions, they can co-release serotonin and glutamate, and they play an important role in the cycle of sleeping and wakefulness (see Chapters 59 and 60)."

This resting membrane potential is somewhat less negative than that found in large peripheral nerve fibers and in skeletal muscle fibers; the lower voltage is important because it allows both positive and negative control of the degree of excitability of the neuron. That is, decreasing the voltage to a less negative value makes the membrane of the neuron more excitable, whereas in- creasing this voltage to a more negative value makes the neuron less excitable. This mechanism is the basis for the two modes of function of the neuron—either excitation or inhibition—as explained in the next sections.",

Figure 46-9 also shows the concentration differences across the neuronal somal membrane of the three ions that are most important for neuronal function—sodium ions, potassium ions, and chloride ions. At the top of this figure, the sodium ion concentration is shown to be high in the extracellular fluid (142 mEq/L) but low inside the neuron (14 mEq/L). This sodium concentration gradient is caused by a strong somal membrane sodium pump that continually pumps sodium out of the neuron.",

The membrane may be somewhat permeable to chloride ions, and there may be a weak chloride pump. Yet, most of the reason for the low con- centration of chloride ions inside the neuron is the -65 mV in the neuron. That is, this negative voltage repels the negatively charged chloride ions, forcing them outward through channels until the concentration is much less inside the membrane than outside.",
          "Let us recall from Chapters 4 and 5 that an electrical potential across the cell membrane can oppose move- ment of ions through a membrane if the potential is of proper polarity and magnitude. A potential that exactly opposes movement of an ion is called the Nernst potential for that ion, represented by the following equation:",

          "For the sodium concentration difference shown in Fig- ure 46-9 (142 mEq/L on the exterior and 14 mEq/L on the interior), the membrane potential that will exactly oppose sodium ion movement through the sodium channels calculates to be +61 mV. However, the actual membrane potential is -65 mV, not +61 mV. Therefore, the sodium ions that leak to the interior are immediately pumped back to the exterior by the sodium pump, thus maintain- ing the -65-mV negative potential inside the neuron.",
          "For potassium ions, the concentration gradient is 120 mEq/L inside the neuron and 4.5 mEq/L outside. This concentration gradient calculates to be a Nernst potential of -86 mV inside the neuron, which is more negative than the —65 that actually exists. Therefore, because of the high intracellular potassium ion concentration, there is a net tendency for potassium ions to diffuse to the outside of the neuron, but this action is opposed by continual pump- ing of these potassium ions back to the interior.",
          "Finally, the chloride ion gradient, 107 mEq/L outside and 8 mEq/L inside, yields a Nernst potential of -70 mV inside the neuron, which is only slightly more negative than the actual measured value of -65 mV. Therefore, chloride ions tend to leak very slightly to the interior of the neuron, but those few that do leak are moved back to the exterior, perhaps by an active chloride pump.",

          "Uniform Distribution of Electrical Potential Inside the Neuronal Soma. The interior of the neuronal soma con- tains a highly conductive electrolytic solution, the intra- cellular fluid of the neuron. Furthermore, the diameter of the neuronal soma is large (from 10 to 80 micrometers), causing almost no resistance to conduction of electric current from one part of the somal interior to another part. Therefore, any change in potential in any part of the intrasomal fluid causes an almost exactly equal change in potential at all other points inside the soma, as long as the neuron is not transmitting an action potential. This prin- ciple is important because it plays a major role in “summa- tion” of signals entering the neuron from multiple sources, as we shall see in subsequent sections of this chapter.",

          "Figure 46-10B shows a presynaptic terminal that has secreted an excitatory transmitter into the cleft between the terminal and neuronal somal membrane. This trans- mitter acts on the membrane excitatory receptor to increase the membrane’s permeability to Na*. Because of the large sodium concentration gradient and large electri- cal negativity inside the neuron, sodium ions diffuse rap- idly to the inside of the membrane.",
          "The rapid influx of positively charged sodium ions to the interior neutralizes part of the negativity of the resting membrane potential. Thus, in Figure 46-108, the resting membrane potential has increased in the positive direc- tion from —65 to —45 mV. This positive increase in voltage above the normal resting neuronal potential—that is, to a less negative value—is called the excitatory postsynap- tic potential (EPSP), because if this potential rises high enough in the positive direction, it will elicit an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, thus exciting it. (In this case, the EPSP is +20 mV—i.e., 20 mV more positive than the resting value.)",
          "Discharge of a single presynaptic terminal can never increase the neuronal potential from —65 mV all the way up to -45 mV. An increase of this magnitude requires simultaneous discharge of many terminals—about 40 to 80 for the usual anterior motor neuron—at the same time or in rapid succession. This simultaneous discharge occurs by a process called summation, discussed in the next sections.",
          "Generation of Action Potentials in the Initial Segment of the Axon Leaving the Neuron—Threshold for Excitation. When the EPSP rises high enough in the positive direction, there comes a point at which this rise initiates an action potential in the neuron. However, the action potential does not begin adjacent to the excita- tory synapses. Instead, it begins in the initial segment of the axon where the axon leaves the neuronal soma. The main reason for this point of origin of the action potential is that the soma has relatively few voltage-gated sodium channels in its membrane, which makes it difficult for the EPSP to open the required number of sodium channels to elicit an action potential. Conversely, the membrane of the initial segment has seven times as great a concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels as the soma and, there- fore, can generate an action potential with much greater ease than can the soma. The EPSP that will elicit an ac- tion potential in the axon initial segment is between +10 and +20 mV, in contrast to the +30 or +40 mV or more required on the soma.",
          "Once the action potential begins, it travels peripherally along the axon and usually also backward over the soma. In some cases, it travels backward into the dendrites but not into all of them because they, like the neuronal soma, have very few voltage-gated sodium channels and there- fore frequently cannot generate action potentials at all. Thus, in Figure 46-10B, the threshold for excitation of the neuron is shown to be about —45 mV, which represents an EPSP of +20 mV—that is, 20 mV more positive than the normal resting neuronal potential of -65 mV."

The inhibitory synapses mainly open chloride channels, allow- ing for easier passage of chloride ions. To understand how the inhibitory synapses inhibit the postsynaptic neuron, we must recall what we learned about the Nernst poten- tial for chloride ions. We calculated the Nernst potential for chloride ions to be about -70 mV. This potential is more negative than the -65 mV normally present inside the resting neuronal membrane. Therefore, opening the chloride channels will allow negatively charged chloride ions to move from the extracellular fluid to the interior, which will make the interior membrane potential more negative than normal, approaching the —70 mV level.",

Thus, both chloride influx and potas- sium efflux increase the degree of intracellular negativity, called hyperpolarization. The neuron is inhibited because the membrane potential is even more negative than the normal intracellular potential. Therefore, an increase in negativity beyond the normal resting membrane potential level is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).",

Therefore, for each excitatory syn- apse that discharges simultaneously, the total intrasomal potential becomes more positive by 0.5 to 1.0 mV.

The dendrites are long, and their mem- branes are thin and at least partially permeable to potas- sium and chloride ions, making them “leaky” to electric current. Therefore, before the excitatory potentials can reach the soma, a large share of the potential is lost by leakage through the membrane. This decrease in mem- brane potential as it spreads electrotonically along den- drites toward the soma is called decremental conduction.",

When excitatory synapses are repetitively stimulated at a rapid rate, the number of discharges by the postsynaptic neuron is at first very great, but the firing rate becomes progressively less in succeeding milliseconds or seconds. This phenom- enon is called fatigue of synaptic transmission.",
          "Fatigue is an exceedingly important characteristic of synaptic function because when areas of the nervous system become overexcited, fatigue causes them to lose this excess excitability after a while. For example, fatigue is probably the most important means whereby the excess excitability of the brain during an epileptic seizure is finally subdued so that the seizure ceases. Thus, the development of fatigue is a protective mechanism against excess neuronal activity. This subject is discussed further in the description of reverberating neuronal circuits in Chapter 47.",
          "The mechanism of fatigue is mainly exhaustion or partial exhaustion of the stores of transmitters in the presynaptic terminals. The excitatory terminals on many neurons can store enough excitatory transmitter to cause only about 10,000 action potentials, and the transmitter can be exhausted in only a few seconds to a few minutes of rapid stimulation. Part of the fatigue process probably results from two other factors as well: (1) progressive inac- tivation of many of the postsynaptic membrane receptors; and (2) slow development of abnormal concentrations of ions inside the postsynaptic neuronal cell.",
          "Effect of Acidosis or Alkalosis on Synaptic Transmission. Most neurons are highly responsive to changes in pH of the surrounding interstitial fluids. Nor- mally, alkalosis greatly increases neuronal excitability. For example, a rise in arterial blood pH from the 7.4 norm to 7.8 to 8.0 often causes cerebral epileptic seizures because of increased excitability of some or all of the cerebral neu- rons. Ina person who is predisposed to epileptic seizures, even a short period of hyperventilation, which blows off carbon dioxide and elevates the pH, may precipitate an epileptic attack.",
          "Conversely, acidosis greatly depresses neuronal activ- ity; a fall in pH from 7.4 to below 7.0 usually causes a comatose state. For example, in very severe diabetic or uremic acidosis, coma almost always develops.",
          "Effect of Hypoxia on Synaptic Transmission. Neuronal excitability is also highly dependent on an adequate sup- ply of oxygen. Cessation of oxygen for only a few seconds can cause complete inexcitability of some neurons. This effect is observed when the brain's blood flow is tempo- rarily interrupted because within 3 to 7 seconds, the per- son becomes unconscious.",
          "Effect of Drugs on Synaptic Transmission. Many drugs are known to increase the excitability of neurons, and others are known to decrease excitability. For example, caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine, which are found in coffee, tea, and cocoa, respectively, all increase neu- ronal excitability, presumably by reducing the threshold for excitation of neurons.",
          "Strychnine is one of the best known of all agents that increase excitability of neurons. However, it does not do this by reducing the threshold for excitation of the neurons; instead, it inhibits the action of some normally inhibitory transmitter substances, especially the inhibitory effect of glycine in the spinal cord. Therefore, the effects of the excitatory transmitters become overwhelming, and the neurons become so excited that they go into rap- idly repetitive discharge, resulting in severe tonic muscle spasms.",
          "Most anesthetics increase the neuronal membrane threshold for excitation and thereby decrease synap- tic transmission at many points in the nervous system. Because many of the anesthetics are especially lipid- soluble, some of them might change the physical charac- teristics of the neuronal membranes, making them less responsive to excitatory agents.",
          "Synaptic Delay. During transmission of a neuronal sig- nal from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron, a certain amount of time is consumed in the process of (1) discharge of the transmitter substance by the presynaptic terminal; (2) diffusion of the transmitter to the postsyn- aptic neuronal membrane; (3) action of the transmitter on the membrane receptor; (4) action of the receptor to increase the membrane permeability; and (5) inward dif- fusion of sodium to raise the EPSP to a high enough level to elicit an action potential. The minimal period of time required for all these events to take place, even when large numbers of excitatory synapses are stimulated simultane- ously, is about 0.5 millisecond, called the synaptic delay. Neurophysiologists can measure the minimal delay time between an input volley of impulses into a pool of neu- rons and the consequent output volley. From the meas- urement of delay time, one can then estimate the number of series neurons in the circuit."

The answer is “by differential sensitivities.” That is, each type of receptor is highly sensi- tive to one type of stimulus for which it is designed and yet is almost nonresponsive to other types of sensory stimuli. Thus, the rods and cones of the eyes are highly responsive to light but are almost completely nonre- sponsive to normal ranges of heat, cold, pressure on the eyeballs, or chemical changes in the blood. The osmo- receptors of the supraoptic nuclei in the hypothalamus detect minute changes in the osmolality of the body fluids but have never been known to respond to sound. Finally, pain receptors in the skin are almost never stimulated by usual touch or pressure stimuli but do become highly active the moment tactile stimuli become severe enough to damage the tissues."

Yet, despite the fact that we experi- ence these different modalities of sensation, nerve fibers transmit only impulses. Therefore, how do different nerve fibers transmit different modalities of sensation?",
          "The answer is that each nerve tract terminates at a spe- cific point in the central nervous system, and the type of sen- sation felt when a nerve fiber is stimulated is determined by the point in the nervous system to which the fiber leads. For example, if a pain fiber is stimulated, the person perceives pain regardless of what type of stimulus excites the fiber. The stimulus can be electricity, overheating of the fiber, crushing of the fiber, or stimulation of the pain nerve ending by dam- age to the tissue cells. In all these cases, the person perceives pain. Likewise, if a touch fiber is stimulated by electrical exci- tation of a touch receptor or in any other way, the person perceives touch because touch fibers lead to specific touch areas in the brain. Similarly, fibers from the retina of the eye terminate in the vision areas of the brain, fibers from the ear terminate in the auditory areas of the brain, and temperature fibers terminate in the temperature areas.",

Different recep- tors can be excited in one of several ways to cause re- ceptor potentials: (1) by mechanical deformation of the receptor, which stretches the receptor membrane and opens ion channels; (2) by application of a chemical to the membrane, which also opens ion channels; (3) by change of the temperature of the membrane, which alters the permeability of the membrane; or (4) by the effects of electromagnetic radiation, such as light on a retinal visual receptor, which either directly or indirectly changes the receptor membrane characteristics and allows ions to flow through membrane channels.",
          "These four means of exciting receptors correspond in general to the different types of known sensory receptors. In all cases, the basic cause of the change in membrane potential is a change in membrane permeability of the receptor, which allows ions to diffuse more or less readily through the membrane and thereby to change the trans- membrane potential.",
          "Maximum Receptor Potential Amplitude. The maxi- mum amplitude of most sensory receptor potentials is about 100 mV, but this level occurs only at an extremely high intensity of sensory stimulus. This is about the same maximum voltage recorded in action potentials and is also the change in voltage when the membrane becomes maximally permeable to sodium ions.",
          "Relation of the Receptor Potential to Action Po- tentials. When the receptor potential rises above the threshold for eliciting action potentials in the nerve fiber attached to the receptor, then action potentials occur, as illustrated in Figure 47-2. Note also that the more the re- ceptor potential rises above the threshold level, the great- er becomes the action potential frequency."

Surround- ing this central nerve fiber are multiple concentric capsule layers; thus, compression anywhere on the outside of the corpuscle will elongate, indent, or otherwise deform the central fiber.",
          "Figure 47-3 shows only the central fiber of the Pacin- ian corpuscle after all capsule layers but one have been removed. The tip of the central fiber inside the capsule is unmyelinated, but the fiber does become myelinated (the blue sheath shown in the figure) shortly before leaving the corpuscle to enter a peripheral sensory nerve.",
          "Figure 47-3 also shows the mechanism whereby a receptor potential is produced in the Pacinian corpuscle. Observe the small area of the terminal fiber that has been deformed by compression of the corpuscle, and note that ion channels have opened in the membrane, allowing positively charged sodium ions to diffuse to the interior of the fiber. This action creates increased positivity inside the fiber, called the “receptor potential” The receptor potential in turn induces a local circuit of current flow, shown by the arrows, that spreads along the nerve fiber. At the first node of Ranvier, which lies inside the capsule of the Pacinian corpuscle, the local current flow depolar- izes the fiber membrane at this node, which then sets off typical action potentials that are transmitted along the nerve fiber toward the central nervous system.",
          "Relation Between Stimulus Intensity and the Recep- tor Potential. Figure 47-4 shows the changing amplitude of the receptor potential caused by progressively stronger mechanical compression (increasing “stimulus strength”) applied experimentally to the central core of a Pacinian corpuscle. Note that the amplitude increases rapidly at first but then progressively less rapidly at high stimulus strength.",
          "In turn, the frequency of repetitive action potentials transmitted from sensory receptors increases approxi- mately in proportion to the increase in receptor potential. Putting this principle together with the data in Figure 47- 4, one can see that very intense stimulation of the recep- tor causes progressively less and less additional increase in numbers of action potentials. This exceedingly impor- tant principle is applicable to almost all sensory receptors. It allows the receptor to be sensitive to very weak sensory experience and yet not reach a maximum firing rate until the sensory experience is extreme. This feature allows the receptor to have an extreme range of response—from very weak to very intense."

That is, when a continuous sen- sory stimulus is applied, the receptor responds at a high impulse rate at first and then at a progressively slower rate until, finally, the rate of action potentials decreases to very few or to none at all.",
          "Figure 47-5 shows typical adaptation of certain types of receptors. Note that the Pacinian corpuscle adapts very rapidly, hair receptors adapt within a second or so, and some joint capsule and muscle spindle receptors adapt slowly.",
          "Furthermore, some sensory receptors adapt to a far greater extent than others. For example, the Pacinian cor- puscles adapt to “extinction” within a few hundredths of a second, and the receptors at the bases of the hairs adapt to extinction within a second or more. It is probable that most mechanoreceptors eventually adapt almost com- pletely, but some require hours or days to do so, and they are called “nonadapting” receptors. The longest measured time for almost complete adaptation of a mechanorecep- tor is about 2 days, which is the adaptation time for many carotid and aortic baroreceptors; however, some physiol- ogists believe that these specialized baroreceptors never fully adapt. Some of the nonmechanoreceptors—the che- moreceptors and pain receptors, for example—probably never adapt completely.",
          "Mechanisms by Which Receptors Adapt. The mecha- nism of receptor adaptation is different for each type of receptor in much the same way that development of a receptor potential is an individual property. For example, in the eye, the rods and cones adapt by changing the con- centrations of their light-sensitive chemicals (discussed in Chapter 51).",
          "In the case of the mechanoreceptors, the receptor that has been studied in greatest detail is the Pacinian cor- puscle. Adaptation occurs in this receptor in two ways. First, the Pacinian corpuscle is a viscoelastic structure, so that when a distorting force is suddenly applied to one side of the corpuscle, this force is instantly transmitted by the viscous component of the corpuscle directly to the same side of the central nerve fiber, thus eliciting a recep- tor potential. However, within a few hundredths of a sec- ond, the fluid within the corpuscle redistributes, and the receptor potential is no longer elicited. Thus, the receptor potential appears at the onset of compression but disap- pears within a small fraction of a second, even though the compression continues.",
          "The second, much slower mechanism of adaptation of the Pacinian corpuscle results from a process called accommodation, which occurs in the nerve fiber itself. That is, even if by chance the central core fiber should continue to be distorted, the tip of the nerve fiber gradu- ally becomes accommodated to the stimulus. This prob- ably results from progressive “inactivation” of the sodium channels in the nerve fiber membrane, which means that sodium current flow through the channels causes them to close gradually, an effect that seems to occur for all or most cell membrane sodium channels, as was explained in Chapter 5.",
          "Presumably, these same two general mechanisms of adaptation also apply to the other types of mechano- receptors. That is, part of the adaptation results from readjustments in the structure of the receptor, and part results from an electrical type of accommodation in the terminal nerve fibril.",
          "Slowly Adapting Receptors Detect Continuous Stim- ulus Strength—the “Tonic” Receptors. Slowly adapting receptors continue to transmit impulses to the brain as long as the stimulus is present (or at least for many min- utes or hours). Therefore, they keep the brain constantly apprised of the status of the body and its relation to its surroundings. For example, impulses from the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon apparatuses allow the nervous system to know the status of muscle contraction and load on the muscle tendon at each instant.",
          "Other slowly adapting receptors include the following: (1) receptors of the macula in the vestibular apparatus; (2) pain receptors; (3) baroreceptors of the arterial tree; and (4) chemoreceptors of the carotid and aortic bodies.",
          "Because the slowly adapting receptors can continue to transmit information for many hours, or even days, they are called tonic receptors.",
          "Rapidly Adapting Receptors Detect Change in Stimu- lus Strength—the “Rate Receptors,” “Movement Re- ceptors,” or “Phasic Receptors.” Receptors that adapt rapidly cannot be used to transmit a continuous signal be- cause they are stimulated only when the stimulus strength changes. Yet, they react strongly while a change is actu- ally taking place. Therefore, these receptors are called rate receptors, movement receptors, or phasic receptors. Thus, in the case of the Pacinian corpuscle, sudden pressure applied to the tissue excites this receptor for a few mil- liseconds, and then its excitation is over, even though the pressure continues. Later, however, it transmits a signal again when the pressure is released. In other words, the Pacinian corpuscle is exceedingly important in apprising the nervous system of rapid tissue deformations, but it is useless for transmitting information about constant con- ditions in the body.",
          "Predictive Function of the Rate Receptors. If the rate at which some change in the body’s status is taking place is known, the state of the body a few seconds or even a few minutes later can be predicted. For example, the recep- tors of the semicircular canals in the vestibular apparatus of the ear detect the rate at which the head begins to turn when a person runs around a curve. Using this informa- tion, a person can predict how much he or she will turn within the next 2 seconds and can adjust the motion of the legs ahead of time to keep from losing balance. Like- wise, receptors located in or near the joints help detect the rates of movement of the different parts of the body. For example, when a person is running, information from the joint rate receptors allows the nervous system to pre- dict where the feet will be during any precise fraction of the next second. Therefore, appropriate motor signals can be transmitted to the muscles of the legs to make any necessary anticipatory corrections in position so that the person will not fall. Loss of this predictive function makes it impossible for the person to run."

An example of this is the sensory signals that apprise the brain of the momentary positions of the legs at each fraction of a second during running. At the other extreme, some types of sensory in- formation, such as that depicting prolonged aching pain, do not need to be transmitted rapidly, and thus slowly conducting fibers will suffice.

These two mechanisms are called, respectively, spa- tial summation and temporal summation.",

This figure shows a section of skin in- nervated by a large number of parallel pain fibers. Each of these fibers arborizes into hundreds of minute free nerve endings that serve as pain receptors. The entire cluster of fibers from one pain fiber frequently covers an area of skin as large as 5 centimeters in diameter. This area is called the receptor field of that fiber. The num- ber of endings is large in the center of the field but di- minishes toward the periphery. One can also see from the figure that the arborizing fibrils overlap those from other pain fibers. Therefore, a pinprick of the skin usu- ally stimulates endings from many different pain fibers simultaneously. When the pinprick is in the center of the receptive field of a particular pain fiber, the degree of stimulation of that fiber is far greater than when it is in the periphery of the field because of the greater number of free nerve endings in the middle of the field.",

The other two views of the nerve cross section show the effect of a moderate stimulus and a strong stimulus, with progressively more fibers being stimulated. Thus, the stronger signals spread to more and more fibers, a phenomenon called spatial summation.",

For example, in Figure 47-9, let us assume that six terminals must discharge almost simulta- neously to excite any one of the neurons. Note that input fiber 1 has more than enough terminals to cause neuron a to discharge. The stimulus from input fiber 1 to this neu- ron is said to be an excitatory stimulus; it is also called a suprathreshold stimulus because it is above the threshold required for excitation.",

Then, the signals from the interneurons converge on the anterior motor neurons to control muscle function.",
          "Such convergence allows summation of information from different sources, and the resulting response is a summated effect of all the different types of information. Convergence is one of the important means whereby the central nervous system correlates, summates, and sorts different types of information."

For example, at the same time that an excit- atory signal is transmitted by one set of neurons in the spinal cord to cause forward movement of a leg, an inhibitory signal is transmitted through a separate set of neurons to inhibit the muscles on the back of the leg so that they will not oppose the forward movement. This type of circuit is characteristic for controlling all antagonistic pairs of muscles; it is called the reciprocal inhibition circuit.",
          "Figure 47-13 shows the means whereby the inhi- bition is achieved. The input fiber directly excites the excitatory output pathway, but it stimulates an inter- mediate inhibitory neuron (neuron 2), which secretes a different type of transmitter substance to inhibit the second output pathway from the pool. This type of circuit is also important in preventing overactivity in many parts of the brain."

However, in many cases, a signal entering a pool causes a prolonged output dis- arge, called afterdischarge, lasting a few milliseconds to as long as many minutes after the incoming signal is over. The most important mechanisms whereby afterdischarge ccurs are described in the following sections.",
          "Synaptic Afterdischarge. When excitatory synapses dis- charge on the surfaces of dendrites or soma of a neuron, a postsynaptic electrical potential develops in the neuron and lasts for many milliseconds, especially when some of the long-acting synaptic transmitter substances are involved. As long as this potential lasts, it can continue to excite the neuron, causing it to transmit a continuous train of output impulses, as was explained in Chapter 46. Thus, as a result of this synaptic afterdischarge mecha- nism alone, it is possible for a single instantaneous input signal to cause a sustained signal output (a series of re- petitive discharges) lasting for many milliseconds.",
          "Reverberatory (Oscillatory) Circuit as a Cause of Signal Prolongation. One of the most important of all circuits in the entire nervous system is the reverberatory or oscillatory circuit. Such circuits are caused by positive feedback within the neuronal circuit that feeds back to re- excite the input of the same circuit. Consequently, once stimulated, the circuit may discharge repetitively for a long time.",
          "Several possible varieties of reverberatory circuits are shown in Figure 47-14. The simplest, shown in Figure 47-14A, involves only a single neuron. In this case, the output neuron sends a collateral nerve fiber back to its own dendrites or soma to restimulate itself. Although the importance of this type of circuit is not clear, theo- retically, once the neuron discharges, the feedback stimuli could keep the neuron discharging for a protracted time thereafter.",
          "Figure 47-14B shows a few additional neurons in the feedback circuit, which causes a longer delay between initial discharge and the feedback signal. Figure 47-14C shows a more complex system in which both facilitatory and inhibitory fibers impinge on the reverberating circuit. A facilitatory signal enhances the intensity and frequency of reverberation, whereas an inhibitory signal depresses or stops the reverberation.",
          "Figure 47-14D shows that most reverberating path- ways are constituted of many parallel fibers. At each cell station, the terminal fibrils spread widely. In such a sys- tem, the total reverberating signal can be either weak or strong, depending on how many parallel nerve fibers are momentarily involved in the reverberation.",
          "Signal Prolongation Characteristics of a Reverbera- tory Circuit. Figure 47-15 shows output signals from a typical reverberatory circuit. The input stimulus may last only 1 millisecond or so, and yet the output can last for many milliseconds or even minutes. The figure demon- strates that the intensity of the output signal usually in- creases to a high value early in reverberation and then decreases to a critical point, at which it suddenly ceases entirely. The cause of this sudden cessation of reverbera- tion is fatigue of synaptic junctions in the circuit. Fatigue beyond a certain critical level lowers the stimulation of the next neuron in the circuit below threshold level so that the circuit feedback is suddenly broken.",
          "The duration of the total signal before cessation can also be controlled by signals from other parts of the brain that inhibit or facilitate the circuit. These patterns of out- put signals are recorded from motor nerves exciting a muscle involved in a flexor reflex after pain stimulation of the foot (as shown later in Figure 47-18)."

Neurons, like other excitable tissues, dis- charge repetitively if their level of excitatory membrane potential rises above a certain threshold level. The mem- brane potentials of many neurons, even normally, are high enough to cause them to emit impulses continually. This phenomenon occurs especially in many of the neurons of the cerebellum, as well as in most of the interneurons of the spinal cord. The rates at which these cells emit im- pulses can be increased by excitatory signals or decreased by inhibitory signals; inhibitory signals often can decrease the rate of firing to zero.",
          "Continuous Signals Emitted From Reverberating Cir- cuits as a Means for Transmitting Information. A re- verberating circuit that does not fatigue enough to stop reverberation is a source of continuous impulses. Further- more, excitatory impulses entering the reverberating pool can increase the output signal, whereas inhibition can de- crease or even extinguish the signal.",
          "Figure 47-16 shows a continuous output signal from a pool of neurons. The pool may be emitting impulses because of intrinsic neuronal excitability or as a result of reverberation. Note that an excitatory input signal greatly increases the output signal, whereas an inhibitory input signal greatly decreases the output. Students who are familiar with radio transmitters will recognize this to be a carrier wave type of information transmission. That is, the excitatory and inhibitory control signals are not the cause of the output signal, but they do control its changing level of intensity. Note that this carrier wave system allows a decrease in signal intensity, as well as an increase, whereas up to this point, the types of information transmission we have discussed have been mainly positive information rather than negative information. This type of informa- tion transmission is used by the autonomic nervous sys- tem to control such functions as vascular tone, gut tone, degree of constriction of the iris in the eye, and heart rate. That is, the nerve excitatory signal to each of these areas can be either increased or decreased by accessory input signals into the reverberating neuronal pathway."

If this cycle should occur, the brain would be inundated by a mass of uncontrolled reverberating signals—signals that would be transmitting no information but, nevertheless, would be consuming the circuits of the brain so that none of the informational signals could be transmitted. Such an effect occurs in widespread areas of the brain during epileptic seizures. How does the central nervous system prevent this effect from happening all the time? The answer lies mainly in two basic mechanisms that function throughout the cen- tral nervous system: (1) inhibitory circuits; and (2) fatigue of synapses."

Note in each record that the strength of contraction progressively “decrements’—that is, its strength dimin- ishes. Much of this effect is caused by fatigue of synapses in the flexor reflex circuit. Furthermore, the shorter the interval between successive flexor reflexes, the less the intensity of the subsequent reflex response.",

Those neuronal path- ways that are overused usually become rapidly fatigued, so their sensitivities decrease. Conversely, those that are underused become rested, and their sensitivities increase. Thus, fatigue and recovery from fatigue constitute an im- portant short-term means of moderating the sensitivities of the different nervous system circuits. These functions help keep the circuits operating in a range of sensitivity that allows effective function.",
          "Long-Term Changes in Synaptic Sensitivity Caused by Automatic Downregulation or Upregulation of Syn- aptic Receptors. The long-term sensitivities of synapses can be changed tremendously by upregulating the num- ber of receptor proteins at the synaptic sites when there is underactivity and downregulating the receptors when there is overactivity. The mechanism for this process is as follows. Receptor proteins are being formed constantly by the endoplasmic reticular—Golgi apparatus system and are constantly being inserted into the receptor neuron synap- tic membrane. However, when the synapses are overused so that excesses of transmitter substance combine with the receptor proteins, many of these receptors are inacti- vated and removed from the synaptic membrane.",
          "It is indeed fortunate that upregulation and downregu- lation of receptors, as well as other control mechanisms for adjusting synaptic sensitivity, continually adjust the sensitivity in each circuit to almost the exact level required for proper function. Consider for a moment how serious it would be if the sensitivities of only a few of these cir- cuits were abnormally high; one might then expect almost continual muscle cramps, seizures, psychotic distur- bances, hallucinations, mental tension, or other nervous disorders. Fortunately, the automatic controls normally readjust the sensitivities of the circuits back to control- lable ranges of reactivity any time the circuits begin to be too active or too depressed."

Although touch, pressure, and vibration are frequently classified as separate sensations, they are all detected by the same types of receptors. There are three principal differences among them: (1) touch sen- sation generally results from stimulation of tactile recep- tors in the skin or in tissues immediately beneath the skin; (2) pressure sensation generally results from deformation of deeper tissues; and (3) vibration sensation results from rapidly repetitive sensory signals; however, some of the same types of receptors as those for touch and pressure are used.",
          "Tactile Receptors. There are at least six entirely different types of tactile receptors, but many more similar to these also exist. Some were shown in Figure 47-1 (previous chapter); their special characteristics are as follows.",
          "First, some free nerve endings, which are found every- where in the skin and in many other tissues, can detect touch and pressure. For example, even light contact with the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations.",
          "Second, a touch receptor with great sensitivity is the Meissner’s corpuscle (illustrated in Figure 47-1 and Figure 48-1), an elongated encapsulated nerve ending of a large (type AB) myelinated sensory nerve fiber. Inside the capsu- lation are many branching terminal nerve filaments. These corpuscles are present in the nonhairy parts of the skin and are particularly abundant in the fingertips, lips, and other areas of the skin where a person’s ability to discern spatial locations of touch sensations is highly developed. Meissner corpuscles adapt in a fraction of a second after they are stimulated, which means that they are particularly sensitive to movement of objects over the surface of the skin, as well as to low-frequency vibration.",
          "Third, the fingertips and other areas that contain large numbers of Meissner’s corpuscles usually also contain large numbers of expanded tip tactile receptors, one type of which is Merkel’s discs, shown in Figure 48-1. The hairy parts of the skin also contain moderate numbers of expanded tip receptors, even though they have almost no Meissner’s corpuscles. These receptors differ from Meissner’s corpuscles in that they transmit an initially strong but partially adapting signal and then a continuing weaker signal that adapts only slowly. Therefore, they are",
          "responsible for giving out steady-state signals that allow one to determine continuous touch of objects against the skin.",
          "Merkel discs are often grouped together in a receptor organ called touch domes, which project upward against the underside of the epithelium of the skin. This upward projection causes the epithelium at this point to pro- trude outward, thus creating a dome and constituting an extremely sensitive receptor. Also note in Figure 48-1 that the entire group of Merkel’s discs is innervated by a single large myelinated nerve fiber (type Af). These receptors, along with the Meissner’s corpuscles discussed earlier, play extremely important roles in localizing touch sensa- tions to specific surface areas of the body and in determin- ing the texture of what is felt.",
          "Fourth, slight movement of any hair on the body stim- ulates a nerve fiber entwining its base. Thus, each hair and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-organ (Fig- ure 48-1), are also touch receptors. A receptor adapts readily and, like Meissner’s corpuscles, detects mainly the following: (1) movement of objects on the surface of the body; or (2) initial contact with the body.",
          "Fifth, located in the deeper layers of the skin and also in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini’s endings, which are multibranched encapsulated endings, as shown in Figure 47-1 and Figure 48-1. These endings adapt very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals. They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation.",
          "Sixth, Pacinian corpuscles, which were discussed in detail in Chapter 47, lie both immediately beneath the skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body. They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tis- sues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second. Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical state of the tissues.",
          "Transmission of Tactile Signals in Peripheral Nerve Fibers. Almost all specialized sensory receptors, such as Meissner’s corpuscles, Iggo dome receptors, hair recep- tors, Pacinian corpuscles, and Ruffini’s endings, transmit their signals in type AB nerve fibers that have transmis- sion velocities ranging from 30 to 70 m/sec. Conversely, free nerve ending tactile receptors transmit signals mainly via the small type Aé myelinated fibers that conduct at velocities of only 5 to 30 m/sec.",
          "Some tactile free nerve endings transmit via type C unmyelinated fibers at velocities from a fraction of a meter up to 2 m/sec. These nerve endings send signals into the spinal cord and lower brain stem, probably sub- serving mainly the sensation of tickle.",
          "Thus, the more critical types of sensory signals—those that help to determine precise localization on the skin, minute gradations of intensity, or rapid changes in sen- sory signal intensity—are all transmitted in more rapidly conducting types of sensory nerve fibers. Conversely, the cruder types of signals, such as pressure, poorly localized touch, and especially tickle, are transmitted via much slower, very small nerve fibers that require much less space in the peripheral nerve bundle than the fast fibers.",
          "Detection of Vibration. All tactile receptors are involved in detection of vibration, although different receptors detect different frequencies of vibration. Pacinian corpuscles can detect signal vibrations from 30 to 800 cycles/ sec because they respond extremely rapidly to minute and  rapid deformations of the tissues. They also transmit their  signals over type Aβ nerve fibers, which can transmit as  many as 1000 impulses/sec. Low-frequency vibrations  from 2 up to 80 cycles/sec, in contrast, stimulate other  tactile receptors, especially Meissner’s corpuscles, which  adapt less rapidly than do Pacinian corpuscles.",
          "Detection of Tickle and Itch by Mechanoreceptive Free Nerve Endings. Neurophysiological studies have demonstrated the existence of very sensitive, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptive free nerve endings that elicit only the tickle and itch sensations. Furthermore, these endings are found almost exclusively in superficial layers of the skin, which is also the only tissue from which the tickle and itch sensations usually can be elicited. These sensations are transmitted by very small type C, unmyeli- nated fibers similar to those that transmit the aching slow type of pain.",
          "The purpose of the itch sensation is presumably to call attention to mild surface stimuli such as a flea crawling on the skin or a fly about to bite; the signals elicited then activate the scratch reflex or other maneuvers that rid the host of the irritant. Itch can be relieved by scratching if this action removes the irritant or if the scratch is strong enough to elicit pain. The pain signals are believed to sup- press the itch signals in the cord by lateral inhibition, as described in Chapter 49."

          "Somatosensory area I has a high degree of localiza- tion of the different parts of the body, as shown by the names of virtually all parts of the body in Figure 48-6. By contrast, localization is poor in somatosensory area II, although, roughly, the face is represented anteriorly, the arms centrally, and the legs posteriorly.",
          "Much less is known about the function of somato- sensory area II. It is known that signals enter this area from the brain stem, transmitted upward from both sides of the body. Also, many signals come secondarily from somatosensory area I and from other sensory areas of the brain, even from the visual and auditory areas. Projec- tions from somatosensory area I are required for func- tion of somatosensory area II. However, removal of parts of somatosensory area II has no apparent effect on the response of neurons in somatosensory area I. Thus, much of what we know about somatic sensation appears to be explained by the functions of somatosensory area I.",

For example, a great num- ber of specialized nerve endings are found in the lips and thumb, whereas only a few are present in the skin of the body trunk.",

          "The cerebral cortex contains six layers of neurons, begin- ning with layer I next to the brain surface and extending progressively deeper to layer VI, shown in Figure 48-8. As would be expected, the neurons in each layer perform functions different from those in other layers. Some of these functions are the following: \n 1. The incoming sensory signal excites neuronal layer IV first; the signal then spreads toward the surface of the cortex and also toward deeper layers. \n 2. Layers I and II receive diffuse, nonspecific input sig- nals from lower brain centers that facilitate specific regions of the cortex; this system is described in Chapter 58. This input mainly controls the overall lev- el of excitability of the respective regions stimulated. \n 3. The neurons in layers II and III send axons to re- lated portions of the cerebral cortex on the opposite side of the brain through the corpus callosum. \n 4. The neurons in layers V and VI send axons to the deeper parts of the nervous system. Those in layer V are generally larger and project to more distant areas, such as to the basal ganglia, brain stem, and spinal cord, where they control signal transmission. From layer VI, especially large numbers of axons extend to the thalamus, providing signals from the cerebral cortex that interact with and help to con- trol the excitatory levels of incoming sensory signals entering the thalamus."

Each of these columns serves a single specific sensory modality; some columns respond to stretch receptors around joints, some to stimulation of tactile hairs, others to discrete localized pressure points on the skin, and so forth. At layer IV, where the input sen- sory signals first enter the cortex, the columns of neurons function almost entirely separately from one another. At other levels of the columns, interactions occur that initi- ate analysis of the meanings of the sensory signals.",

Many of the signals from these sensory col- umns then spread anteriorly, directly to the motor cor- tex located immediately forward of the central fissure. These signals play a major role in controlling the efflu- ent motor signals that activate sequences of muscle contraction.",

In fact, the person is mainly oblivious to the opposite side of the body—that is, forgets that it is there. Therefore, the person also often forgets to use the other side for motor functions as well.

The upper curves of the figure show that the cortical neurons that discharge to the greatest extent are those in a central part of the cortical “field” for each respective receptor.

On the tips of the fingers, a person can normally distinguish two separate points, even when the needles are as close together as 1 to 2 millimeters. However, on someone’s back, the needles usually must be as far apart as 30 to 70 millimeters before two separate points can be detected. The reason for this difference is the different numbers of specialized tactile receptors in the two areas.",

The blue curve shows the spatial pattern of cortical excitation when both skin points are stimulated simultaneously. Note that the resul- tant zone of excitation has two separate peaks. These two peaks, separated by a valley, allow the sensory cortex to detect the presence of two stimulatory points, rather than a single point. The capability of the sensorium to distin- guish this presence of two points of stimulation is strongly influenced by another mechanism, Jateral inhibition, as explained in the next section.",
          "Effect of Lateral Inhibition to Increase the Degree of Contrast in the Perceived Spatial Pattern. As noted in Chapter 47, virtually every sensory pathway, when excit- ed, gives rise simultaneously to lateral inhibitory signals; these inhibitory signals spread to the sides of the excitato- ry signal and inhibit adjacent neurons. For example, con- sider an excited neuron in a dorsal column nucleus. Aside from the central excitatory signal, short lateral pathways transmit inhibitory signals to the surrounding neurons— that is, these signals pass through additional interneurons that secrete an inhibitory transmitter.",
          "The importance of lateral inhibition, also called sur- round inhibition, is that it blocks lateral spread of the excit- atory signals and, therefore, increases the degree of contrast in the sensory pattern perceived in the cerebral cortex.",

At each of these levels, the lateral inhibi- tion helps to block lateral spread of the excitatory signal. Asa result, the peaks of excitation stand out, and much of the surrounding diffuse stimulation is blocked. This effect is demonstrated by the two red curves in Figure 48-10, showing complete separation of the peaks when the intensity of lateral inhibition is great.",

Therefore, it is important that we discuss briefly some of the principles related to transmission of sensory stimulus intensity to the higher levels of the nervous system.",
          "How is it possible for the sensory system to transmit sensory experiences of tremendously varying intensities? For example, the auditory system can detect the weakest possible whisper but can also discern the meanings of an explosive sound, even though the sound intensities of these two experiences can vary by more than 10 billion times; the eyes can see visual images with light intensities that vary as much as a half-million times, and the skin can detect pres- sure differences of 10,000 to 100,000 times.",
          "As a partial explanation of these effects, Figure 47-4: in the previous chapter shows the relation of the receptor po- tential produced by the Pacinian corpuscle to the intensity of the sensory stimulus. At low stimulus intensity, slight changes in intensity increase the potential markedly, where- as at high levels of stimulus intensity, further increases in receptor potential are slight. Thus, the Pacinian corpuscle is capable of accurately measuring extremely minute changes in stimulus at low-intensity levels but, at high-intensity lev- els, the change in stimulus must be much greater to cause the same amount of change in receptor potential.",
          "The transduction mechanism for detecting sound by the cochlea of the ear demonstrates still another method for separating gradations of stimulus intensity. When sound stimulates a specific point on the basilar membrane, weak sound stimulates only those hair cells at the point of maxi- mum sound vibration. However, as the sound intensity in- creases, many more hair cells in each direction farther away from the maximum vibratory point also become stimulat- ed. Thus, signals are transmitted over progressively increas- ing numbers of nerve fibers, which is another mechanism whereby stimulus intensity is transmitted to the central nervous system. This mechanism, plus the direct effect of stimulus intensity on impulse rate in each nerve fiber, as well as several other mechanisms, make it possible for some sensory systems to operate reasonably faithfully at stimulus intensity levels changing as much as millions of times.",

That is, a person already holding 30 grams weight in the hand can barely detect an additional 1-gram increase in weight and, when already holding 300 grams, can barely detect a 10-gram increase in weight. Thus, in this case, the ratio of the change in stimu- lus strength required for detection remains essentially con- stant, about 1 to 30, which is what the logarithmic principle means. To express this principle mathematically, \n Interpreted signal strength = Log (Stimulus) + Constant",

Most other deep tissues are only sparsely supplied with pain endings; nev- ertheless, any widespread tissue damage can summate to cause the slow, chronic, aching type of pain in most of these areas.",
          "Mechanical, Thermal, and Chemical Stimuli Excite Pain Receptors. Pain can be elicited by multiple types of stimuli, classified as mechanical, thermal, and chemical pain stimuli. In general, fast pain is elicited by the me- chanical and thermal types of stimuli, whereas slow pain can be elicited by all three types.",
          "Some of the chemicals that excite the chemical type of pain are bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, potassium ions, acids, acetylcholine, and proteolytic enzymes. In addition, prostaglandins and substance P enhance the sensitivity of pain endings but do not directly excite them. The chemi- cal substances are especially important in stimulating the slow suffering type of pain that occurs after tissue injury.",
          "Nonadapting Nature of Pain Receptors. In contrast to most other sensory receptors of the body, pain receptors adapt very little and sometimes not at all. In fact, under some conditions, excitation of pain fibers becomes pro- gressively greater, especially for slow, aching, nauseous pain, as the pain stimulus continues. This increase in sen- sitivity of the pain receptors is called hyperalgesia. One can readily understand the importance of this failure of pain receptors to adapt because it allows the pain to keep the person apprised of a tissue-damaging stimulus as long as it persists.",
          "Rate of Tissue Damage as a Stimulus for Pain. The average person begins to perceive pain when the skin is heated above 45°C, as shown in Figure 49-1. This is also the temperature at which the tissues begin to be damaged by heat; indeed, the tissues are eventually destroyed if the temperature remains above this level indefinitely. There- fore, it is immediately apparent that pain resulting from heat is closely correlated with the rate at which damage to the tissues is occurring and not with the total damage that has already occurred.",
          "The intensity of pain is also closely correlated with the rate of tissue damage from causes other than heat, such as bacterial infection, tissue ischemia, tissue contusion, and so forth.",
          "Special Importance of Chemical Pain Stimuli Dur- ing Tissue Damage. Extracts from damaged tissue cause intense pain when injected beneath the normal skin. Most of the chemicals listed earlier that excite the chemical pain receptors can be found in these ex- tracts. One chemical that seems to be more painful than others is bradykinin. Researchers have suggested that bradykinin might be the agent most responsible for causing pain after tissue damage. Also, the inten- sity of the pain felt correlates with the local increase in potassium ion concentration or the increase in pro- teolytic enzymes that directly attack the nerve endings and excite pain by making the nerve membranes more permeable to ions.",
          "Tissue Ischemia as a Cause of Pain. When blood flow to a tissue is blocked, the tissue often becomes very painful within a few minutes. The greater the rate of metabolism of the tissue, the more rapidly the pain appears. For ex- ample, if a blood pressure cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated until the arterial blood flow ceases, exer- cise of the forearm muscles sometimes can cause muscle pain within 15 to 20 seconds. In the absence of muscle exercise, the pain may not appear for 3 to 4 minutes, even though the muscle blood flow remains zero.",
          "One of the suggested causes of pain during ischemia is accumulation of large amounts of lactic acid in the tis- sues, formed as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism (i.e, metabolism without oxygen). It is also probable that other chemical agents, such as bradykinin and proteolytic enzymes, are formed in the tissues because of cell damage and that these agents, in addition to lactic acid, stimulate the pain nerve endings.",
          "Muscle Spasm as a Cause of Pain. Muscle spasm is also a common cause of pain and is the basis of many clinical pain syndromes. This pain probably results partially from the direct effect of muscle spasm in stimulating mecha- nosensitive pain receptors, but it might also result from the indirect effect of muscle spasm to compress the blood vessels and cause ischemia. The spasm also increases the rate of metabolism in the muscle tissue, thus making the relative ischemia even greater, creating ideal conditions for the release of chemical pain-inducing substances."

This slow-chronic pain is transmitted to the spinal cord by type C fibers at velocities between 0.5 and 2 m/sec.",

The sharp pain plays an important role in making the person react immediately to remove himself or herself from the stimulus. The slow pain tends to become greater over time, eventually producing intolerable pain and making the person keep trying to relieve the cause of the pain.",

Most of the signals then pass through one or more addi- tional short fiber neurons within the dorsal horns before entering mainly lamina V, also in the dorsal horn. Here, the last neurons in the series give rise to long axons that mostly join the fibers from the fast pain pathway, passing first through the anterior commissure to the opposite side of the cord and then upward to the brain in the anterolat- eral pathway.",

In fact, it has been suggested that the “dou- ble” pain sensation one feels after a pinprick might result partly from the fact that the glutamate transmitter gives a faster pain sensation, whereas the substance P transmit- ter gives a more lagging sensation. Regardless of the yet unknown details, it seems clear that glutamate is the neu- rotransmitter most involved in transmitting fast pain into the central nervous system, and substance P is concerned with slow-chronic pain.",

Instead, most terminate in one of three areas: (1) the reticular nuclei of the medulla, pons, and mesencephalon; (2) the tectal area of the mes- encephalon deep to the superior and inferior colliculi; or (3) the periaqueductal gray region surrounding the aque- duct of Sylvius. These lower regions of the brain appear to be important for feeling the suffering types of pain. From the brain stem pain areas, multiple short-fiber neurons re- lay the pain signals upward into the intralaminar and ven- trolateral nuclei of the thalamus and into certain portions of the hypothalamus and other basal regions of the brain.",

Localization of pain transmitted via the paleospinothalamic pathway is imprecise. For exam- ple, slow-chronic pain can usually be localized only to a major part of the body, such as to one arm or leg but not to a specific point on the arm or leg. This phenomenon is in keeping with the multisynaptic, diffuse connectivity of this pathway. It explains why patients often have serious difficulty in localizing the source of some chronic types of pain.",

Complete removal of the somatic sensory areas of the cerebral cor- tex does not prevent pain perception.

This does not mean that the cerebral cortex has nothing to do with normal pain ap- preciation; electrical stimulation of cortical somatosen- sory areas does cause a person to perceive mild pain from about 3% of the points stimulated. However, it is believed that the cortex plays an especially important role in inter- preting pain quality, even though pain perception might be principally the function of lower centers.",

These two areas consti- tute part of the brain’s principal arousal system, discussed in Chapter 60. This explains why it is almost impossible for a person to sleep when in severe pain.",

To provide pain relief, the pain nervous path- ways can be cut at any one of several points. If the pain is in the lower part of the body, a cordotomy in the tho- racic region of the spinal cord often relieves the pain for a few weeks to a few months. To perform a cordotomy, the pain-conducting tracts of the spinal cord on the side op- posite to the pain are cut in its anterolateral quadrant to interrupt the anterolateral sensory pathway.",
          "A cordotomy is not always successful in relieving pain for two reasons. First, many pain fibers from the upper part of the body do not cross to the opposite side of the spinal cord until they have reached the brain, and the cordotomy does not transect these fibers. Second, pain frequently returns several months later, partly as a result of sensitiza- tion of other pathways that normally are too weak to be effectual (e.g., sparse pathways in the dorsolateral cord)."

          "The degree to which different people react to pain varies tremendously. This variation results partly from a capabil- ity of the brain itself to suppress input of pain signals to the nervous system by activating a pain control system, called an analgesia system.",
          "The analgesia system, shown in Figure 49-4, consists of three major components: (1) The periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of Sylvius and por- tions of the third and fourth ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second- order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral col- umns in the spinal cord to (3) a pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain.",
          "Electrical stimulation either in the periaqueductal gray area or in the raphe magnus nucleus can suppress many strong pain signals entering via the dorsal spinal roots. Also, stimulation of areas at higher levels of the brain that excite the periaqueductal gray area can also suppress pain. Some of these areas are the following: (1) the periventricu- lar nuclei in the hypothalamus, lying adjacent to the third ventricle; and, to a lesser extent (2) the medial forebrain bundle, also in the hypothalamus.",
          "Several transmitter substances, especially enkephalin and serotonin, are involved in the analgesia system. Many nerve fibers derived from the periventricular nuclei and from the periaqueductal gray area secrete enkephalin at their endings. Thus, as shown in Figure 49-4, the end- ings of many fibers in the raphe magnus nucleus release enkephalin when stimulated.",
          "Fibers originating in this area send signals to the dorsal horns of the spinal cord to secrete serotonin at their end- ings. The serotonin causes local cord neurons to secrete enkephalin as well. The enkephalin is believed to cause both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition of incoming type C and type A6 pain fibers where they synapse in the dorsal horns.",
          "Thus, the analgesia system can block pain signals at the initial entry point to the spinal cord. It can also block many local cord reflexes that result from pain signals, especially withdrawal reflexes described in Chapter 55."

          "More than 50 years ago, it was discovered that injection of minute quantities of morphine either into the peri- ventricular nucleus around the third ventricle or into the periaqueductal gray area of the brain stem causes an extreme degree of analgesia. In subsequent studies, morphine-like agents, mainly the opiates, were found to act at many other points in the analgesia system, including the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. Because most drugs that alter excitability of neurons do so by acting on synaptic receptors, it was assumed that the “morphine receptors” of the analgesia system must be receptors for some morphine-like neurotransmitter that is naturally secreted in the brain. Therefore, an exten- sive search was undertaken for the natural opiate of the brain. About a dozen such opiate-like substances have now been found at different points of the nervous sys- tem. All are breakdown products of three large protein molecules—pro-opiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin. Among the more important of these opiate-like substances are B-endorphin, met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, and dynorphin.",
          "The two enkephalins are found in the brain stem and spinal cord, in the portions of the analgesia system described earlier, and f-endorphin is present in both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Dynorphin is found mainly in the same areas as the enkephalins, but in much lower quantities.",
          "Thus, although the details of the brain’s opiate system are not completely understood, activation of the analgesia system by nervous signals entering the periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas, or inactivation of pain pathways by morphine-like drugs, can almost totally suppress many pain signals entering through the peripheral nerves."

For example, each time a peristaltic wave trav- els along an overly excitable spastic gut, a cramp occurs.

Second, sensations from the abdomen and thorax are transmit- ted through two pathways to the central nervous sys- tem, the true visceral pathway and the parietal pathway. True visceral pain is transmitted via pain sensory fibers in the autonomic nerve bundles, and the sensations are referred to surface areas of the body that are often far from the painful organ. Conversely, parietal sensations are conducted directly into local spinal nerves from the parietal peritoneum, pleura, or pericardium, and these sensations are usually localized directly over the painful area.",

When visceral pain is referred to the surface of the body, the person generally localizes it in the dermatomal segment from which the visceral organ originated in the embryo, not necessarily where the vis- ceral organ now lies. For example, the heart originated in the neck and upper thorax, so the heart’s visceral pain fibers pass upward along the sympathetic sensory nerves and enter the spinal cord between segments C3 and T5. Therefore, as shown in Figure 49-6, pain from the heart is referred to the side of the neck, over the shoulder, over the pectoral muscles, down the arm, and into the substernal area of the upper chest. These are the areas of the body surface that send their own so- matosensory nerve fibers into the C3 to T5 cord seg- ments.

Pain from the viscera is frequently local- ized to two surface areas of the body at the same time because of the dual transmission of pain through the re- ferred visceral pathway and the direct parietal pathway. Thus, Figure 49-7 shows dual transmission from an in- flamed appendix. Pain impulses pass first from the ap- pendix through visceral pain fibers located within sym- pathetic nerve bundles and then into the spinal cord at about T10 or T11; this pain is referred to an area around the umbilicus and is of the aching, cramping type. Pain impulses also often originate in the parietal peritoneum where the inflamed appendix touches or is adherent to the abdominal wall. These impulses cause pain of the sharp type directly over the irritated peritoneum in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen."

An example of primary hyperalgesia is the extreme sen- sitivity of sunburned skin, which results from sensitization of the skin pain endings by local tissue products from the burn—perhaps histamine, prostaglandins, and others.

The pain feels like sudden electrical shocks, and it may appear for only a few seconds at a time or may be almost continuous. Often, it is set off by exceedingly sensitive trigger areas on the surface of the face, in the mouth, or inside the throat—almost always by a mechanoreceptive stimulus rather than a pain stimulus. For example, when the patient swallows a bolus of food, as the food touches a tonsil, it might set off a severe lancinating pain in the mandibular portion of the fifth nerve. \n The pain of tic douloureux can usually be blocked by surgically cutting the peripheral nerve from the hyper- sensitive area. The sensory portion of the fifth nerve is often sectioned immediately inside the cranium, where the motor and sensory roots of the fifth nerve sepa- rate from each other, so that the motor portions, which are necessary for many jaw movements, can be spared while the sensory elements are destroyed. This opera- tion leaves the side of the face anesthetic, which may be annoying. Furthermore, sometimes the operation is un- successful, indicating that the lesion that causes the pain might be in the sensory nucleus in the brain stem and not in the peripheral nerves.",
          "Brown-Séquard Syndrome \n If the spinal cord is transected entirely, all sensations and motor functions distal to the segment of transection are blocked, but if the spinal cord is transected on only one side, the Brown-Séquard syndrome occurs. ‘The effects of such transection can be predicted from knowledge of the cord fiber tracts shown in Figure 49-8. All motor functions are blocked on the side of the transection in all segments below the level of the transection. Yet, only some of the modalities of sensation are lost on the transected side, and others are lost on the opposite side. The sensations of pain, heat, and cold—sensations served by the spinothalamic pathway— are lost on the opposite side of the body in all dermatomes two to six segments below the level of the transection. By contrast, the sensations that are transmitted only in the dorsal and dorsolateral columns—kinesthetic and position sensations, vibration sensation, discrete localization, and two-point discrimination—are lost on the side of the transection in all dermatomes below the level of the transection. Discrete “light touch’ is impaired on the side of the transec- tion because the principal pathway for the transmission of light touch, the dorsal column, is transected. That is, the fibers in this column do not cross to the opposite side until they reach the medulla of the brain. “Crude touch,’ which is poorly localized, still persists because of partial transmis- sion in the opposite spinothalamic tract.",
          "Headache \n Headaches are a type of pain referred to the surface of the head from deep head structures. Some headaches result from pain stimuli arising inside the cranium, but others result from pain arising outside the cranium, such as from the nasal sinuses.",
          "Headache of Intracranial Origin \n Pain-Sensitive Areas in the Cranial Vault. The brain tissues themselves are almost totally insensitive to pain. Even cutting or electrically stimulating the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex only occasionally causes pain; instead, it causes prickly types of paresthesias on the area of the body represented by the portion of the sensory cortex stimu- lated. Therefore, it is likely that much or most of the pain of headache is not caused by damage in the brain itself. \n Conversely, tugging on the venous sinuses around the brain, damaging the tentorium, or stretching the dura at the base of the brain can cause intense pain that is recognized as headache. Also, almost any type of traumatizing, crush- ing, or stretching stimulus to the blood vessels of the menin- ges can cause headache. An especially sensitive structure is the middle meningeal artery; neurosurgeons are careful to anesthetize this artery specifically when performing brain operations with use of local anesthesia. \n Areas of the Head to Which Intracranial Headache Is Referred. Stimulation of pain receptors in the cerebral vault above the tentorium, including the upper surface of the tentorium itself, initiates pain impulses in the cerebral portion of the fifth nerve and, therefore, causes referred headache to the front half of the head in the surface areas supplied by this somatosensory portion of the fifth cranial nerve, as shown in Figure 49-9. \n Conversely, pain impulses from beneath the tentorium enter the central nervous system mainly through the glos- sopharyngeal, vagal, and second cervical nerves, which also supply the scalp above, behind, and slightly below the ear. Subtentorial pain stimuli cause “occipital headache” re- ferred to the posterior part of the head.",
          "Types of Intracranial Headache \n Headache of Meningitis. One of the most severe head- aches of all is that resulting from meningitis, which causes inflammation of the meninges, including the sensitive ar- eas of the dura and the sensitive areas around the venous sinuses. Such intense damage can cause extreme headache pain referred over the entire head. \n Headache Caused by Low Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure. Removing as little as 20 milliliters of fluid from the spinal ca- nal, particularly if the person remains in an upright position, often causes intense intracranial headache. Removing this quantity of fluid removes part of the flotation for the brain that is normally provided by the cerebrospinal fluid. The weight of the brain stretches and otherwise distorts the various dural surfaces and thereby elicits the pain that causes the headache. \n Migraine Headache. Migraine headache is a special type of headache that may result from abnormal vascular function, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Migraine head- aches often begin with various prodromal sensations, such as nausea, loss of vision in part of the field of vision, visual aura, and other types of sensory hallucinations. Ordinarily, the prodromal symptoms begin 30 to 60 minutes before the beginning of the headache. Any theory that explains migraine headache must also explain the prodromal symptoms. \n One theory of migraine headaches is that prolonged emo- tion or tension causes reflex vasospasm of some of the arter- ies of the head, including arteries that supply the brain. The vasospasm theoretically produces ischemia of portions of the brain, which is responsible for the prodromal symptoms. Then, as a result of the intense ischemia, something happens to the vascular walls, perhaps exhaustion of smooth muscle contraction, to allow the blood vessels to become flaccid and incapable of maintaining normal vascular tone for 24 to 48 hours. The blood pressure in the vessels causes them to dilate and pulsate intensely, and it is postulated that the excessive stretching of the walls of the arteries—including some extrac- ranial arteries, such as the temporal artery—causes the actual pain of migraine headaches. Other theories about the cause of migraine headaches include spreading cortical depression, psychological abnormalities, and vasospasm caused by excess local potassium in the cerebral extracellular fluid. \n There may be a genetic predisposition to migraine head- aches because a positive family history for migraine has been reported in 65% to 90% of cases. Migraine headaches also occur about twice as frequently in women as in men. \n Alcoholic Headache. As many people have experienced, a headache often follows excessive alcohol consumption. It is likely that alcohol, because it is toxic to tissues, directly irritates the meninges and causes the intracranial pain. De- hydration may also play a role in the hangover that follows an alcoholic binge; hydration usually attenuates but does not abolish headache and other symptoms of hangover.",
          "Extracranial Types of Headache \n Headache Resulting from Muscle Spasm. Emotional ten- sion often causes many of the muscles of the head, especially the muscles attached to the scalp and the neck muscles attached to the occiput, to become spastic; this mechanism is postulated as acommon cause of headache. The pain of the spastic head mus- cles supposedly is referred to the overlying areas of the head and gives one the same type of headache as do intracranial lesions. \n Headache Caused by Irritation of Nasal and Accessory Nasal Structures. The mucous membranes of the nose and nasal sinuses are sensitive to pain, but not intensely so. Nev- ertheless, infection or other irritative processes in widespread areas of the nasal structures often summate and cause head- ache that is referred behind the eyes or, in the case of frontal si- nus infection, to the frontal surfaces of the forehead and scalp, as shown in Figure 49-9. Also, pain from the lower sinuses, such as from the maxillary sinuses, can be felt in the face. \n Headache Caused by Eye Disorders. Difficulty in focusing one’s eyes clearly may cause excessive contraction of the eye ciliary muscles in an attempt to gain clear vision. Even though these muscles are extremely small, their tonic contraction is be- lieved to cause retro-orbital headache. Also, excessive attempts to focus the eyes can result in reflex spasm in various facial and extraocular muscles, which is a possible cause of headache. \n A second type of headache that originates in the eyes occurs when the eyes are exposed to excessive irradiation by light rays, especially ultraviolet light. Looking at the sun or the arc of an arc welder for even a few seconds may re- sult in headache that lasts from 24 to 48 hours. The head- ache sometimes results from “actinic” irritation of the con- junctivae, and the pain is referred to the surface of the head or retro-orbitally. However, focusing intense light from an arc or the sun on the retina can also burn the retina, which could be the cause of the headache."

          "Thermal gradations are discriminated by at least three types of sensory receptors—cold receptors, warmth receptors, and pain receptors. The pain receptors are stimulated only by extreme degrees of heat or cold and are responsible, along with the cold and warmth receptors, for “freezing cold” and “burning hot” sensations.",
          "The cold and warmth receptors are located imme- diately under the skin at discrete separated spots. Most areas of the body have 3 to 10 times as many cold spots as warmth spots; the number in different areas of the body varies from 15 to 25 cold spots/cm? in the lips to 3 to 5 cold spots/cm? in the finger to less than 1 cold spot/cm? in some broad surface areas of the trunk.",
          "Warmth receptors are believed to be free nerve end- ings because warmth signals are transmitted mainly over unmyelinated type C nerve fibers at transmission veloci- ties of only 0.4 to 2 m/sec.",
          "A definitive cold receptor has been identified. It is a special, small, type Ad myelinated nerve ending that branches several times, the tips of which protrude into the bottom surfaces of basal epidermal cells. Signals are transmitted from these receptors via thinly myelin- ated type Aé nerve fibers at velocities of about 20 m/ sec. Some cold sensations are believed to be transmit- ted in type C nerve fibers as well, which suggests that some free nerve endings also might function as cold receptors.",
          "Stimulation of Thermal Receptors—Sensations of Cold, Cool, Indifferent, Warm, and Hot. Figure 49-10 shows the effects of different temperatures on the respons- es of four types of nerve fibers: (1) a pain fiber stimulated by cold; (2) a cold fiber; (3) a warmth fiber; and (4) a pain fiber stimulated by heat. Note especially that these fibers respond differently at different levels of temperature. For example, in the very cold region, only the cold pain fibers are stimulated (if the skin becomes even colder so that it nearly freezes or actually does freeze, these fibers cannot be stimulated). As the temperature rises to +10°C to 15°C, the cold-pain impulses cease, but the cold receptors begin to be stimulated, reaching peak stimulation at about 24°C and fading out slightly above 40°C. Above about 30°C, the warmth receptors begin to be stimulated, but these also fade out at about 49°C. Finally, at around 45°C, the heat pain fibers begin to be stimulated by heat and, paradoxi- cally, some of the cold fibers begin to be stimulated again, possibly because of damage to the cold endings caused by the excessive heat.",
          "One can understand from Figure 49-10 that a person determines the different gradations of thermal sensa- tions by the relative degrees of stimulation of the dif- ferent types of endings. One can also understand why extreme degrees of both cold and heat can be painful and why both these sensations, when intense enough, may give almost the same quality of sensation—that is, freezing cold and burning hot sensations feel almost alike.",
          "Stimulatory Effects of Rising and Falling Tempera- ture—Adaptation of Thermal Receptors. When a cold receptor is suddenly subjected to an abrupt fall in tem- perature, it becomes strongly stimulated at first, but this stimulation fades rapidly during the first few seconds and progressively more slowly during the next 30 minutes or more. In other words, the receptor “adapts” to a great ex- tent, but never 100%.",
          "Thus, it is evident that the thermal senses respond markedly to changes in temperature in addition to being able to respond to steady states of temperature. This means that when the temperature of the skin is actively falling, a person feels much colder than when the tem- perature remains cold at the same level. Conversely, if the temperature is actively rising, the person feels much warmer than he or she would at the same temperature if it were constant. The response to changes in tempera- ture explains the extreme degree of heat one feels on first entering a tub of hot water and the extreme degree of cold felt on going from a heated room to outdoors on a cold day."

          "It is believed that the cold and warmth receptors are stim- ulated by changes in their metabolic rates, and that these changes result from the fact that temperature alters the rate of intracellular chemical reactions more than twofold for each 10°C change. In other words, thermal detection probably results not from direct physical effects of heat or cold on the nerve endings but from chemical stimulation of the endings as modified by temperature.",
          "Spatial Summation of Thermal Sensations. Because the number of cold or warmth endings in any one sur- face area of the body is slight, it is difficult to judge grada- tions of temperature when small skin areas are stimulated. However, when a large skin area is stimulated all at once, the thermal signals from the entire area are cumulative. For example, rapid changes in temperature as little as 0.01°C can be detected if this change affects the entire surface of the body simultaneously. Conversely, tempera- ture changes 100 times as great often will not be detected when the affected skin area is only 1 square centimeter in size."

After a small amount of processing by one or more cord neurons, the signals enter long, ascend- ing thermal fibers that cross to the opposite anterolateral sensory tract and terminate in both (1) the reticular areas of the brain stem and (2) the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus.",
          "A few thermal signals are also relayed to the cerebral somatic sensory cortex from the ventrobasal complex. Occasionally, a neuron in cortical somatic sensory area I has been found by microelectrode studies to be directly responsive to either cold or warm stimuli on a specific area of the skin. However, removal of the entire cortical postcentral gyrus in a person reduces but does not abolish the ability to distinguish gradations of temperature."

The refractive index of a transparent substance is the ratio of the velocity of light in air to the velocity in the substance. The refractive index of air is 1.00. Thus, if light travels through a particular type of glass at a velocity of 200,000 km/sec, the refractive index of this glass is 300,000 divided by 200,000, or 1.50.",

When light rays traveling forward in a beam (as shown in Figure 50-1A) strike an interface that is perpendicular to the beam, the rays enter the second medium without deviating from their course. The only effect that occurs is decreased velocity of transmission and shorter wavelength, as shown in the figure by the shorter distances between wave fronts.",
          "If the light rays pass through an angulated interface, as shown in Figure 50-1B, the rays bend if the refractive indices of the two media are different from each other. In this figure, the light rays are leaving air, which has a refractive index of 1.00, and are entering a block of glass having a refractive index of 1.50. When the beam first strikes the angulated interface, the lower edge of the beam enters the glass ahead of the upper edge. The wave front in the upper portion of the beam continues to travel at a velocity of 300,000 km/sec, whereas that which entered the glass travels at a velocity of 200,000 km/sec. This difference in velocity causes the upper portion of the wave front to move ahead of the lower portion so that the wave front is no longer vertical but is angulated to the right. Because the direction in which light travels is always perpendicular to the plane of the wave front, the direction of travel of the light beam bends downward.",

Toward either edge of the lens, however, the light rays strike a progressively more angulated interface. The outer rays bend more and more toward the center, which is called convergence of the rays. Half the bending occurs when the rays enter the lens, and half occurs as the rays exit from the opposite side. If the lens has exactly the proper curvature, parallel light rays passing through each part of the lens will be bent exactly enough so that all the rays will pass through a single point, called the focal point.",

The rays at the edge of the lens enter the lens ahead of the rays in the center.

Thus, parallel light rays are bent to a focal line. Conversely, light rays that pass through the spherical lens are refracted at all edges of the lens (in both planes) toward the central ray, and all the rays come to a focal point.",

If the test tube is placed in a beam of sun- light and a piece of paper is brought progressively closer to the opposite side of the tube, a certain distance will be found at which the light rays come to a focal line. The spherical lens is demonstrated by an ordinary magnifying glass. If such a lens is placed in a beam of sunlight, and a piece of paper is brought progressively closer to the lens, the light rays will impinge on a common focal point at an appropriate distance.",

In the reduced eye, a single refractive surface is considered to exist, with its central point 17 millimeters in front of the retina and a total refractive power of 59 di- opters when the lens is accommodated for distant vision.",

The principal reason for this phenomenon is that the refractive index of the cornea is markedly different from that of air, whereas the refractive index of the eye lens is not greatly different from the indi- ces of the aqueous humor and vitreous humor.",

          "In a young person, the lens is composed of a strong elastic capsule filled with viscous, proteinaceous, but transparent fluid. When the lens is in a relaxed state, with no tension on its capsule, it assumes an almost spherical shape, owing mainly to the elastic retraction of the lens capsule. However, as shown in Figure 50-10, about 70 suspensory ligaments attach radially around the lens, pull- ing the lens edges toward the outer circle of the eyeball. hese ligaments are constantly tensed by their attach- ments at the anterior border of the choroid and retina. he tension on the ligaments causes the lens to remain relatively flat under normal eye conditions.",
          "Also located at the lateral attachments of the lens liga- ments to the eyeball is the ciliary muscle, which has two separate sets of smooth muscle fibers—meridional fibers and circular fibers. The meridional fibers extend from the peripheral ends of the suspensory ligaments to the cor- neoscleral junction. When these muscle fibers contract, the peripheral insertions of the lens ligaments are pulled medially toward the edges of the cornea, thereby releas- ing the ligaments’ tension on the lens. The circular fibers are arranged circularly all the way around the ligament attachments so that when they contract, a sphincter-like action occurs, decreasing the diameter of the circle of lig- ament attachments; this action also allows the ligaments to pull less on the lens capsule.",
          "Thus, contraction of either set of smooth muscle fibers in the ciliary muscle relaxes the ligaments to the lens cap- sule, and the lens assumes a more spherical shape, like that of a balloon, because of the natural elasticity of the lens capsule.",
          "Accommodation Is Controlled by Parasympathetic Nerves. Ciliary muscle is controlled almost entirely by par- asympathetic nerve signals transmitted to the eye through the third cranial nerve from the third nerve nucleus in the brain stem, as explained in Chapter 52. Stimulation of par- asympathetic nerves contracts both sets of ciliary muscle fibers, which relaxes the lens ligaments, thus allowing the lens to become thicker and increase its refractive power. With this increased refractive power, the eye focuses on objects nearer than when the eye has less refractive power. Consequently, as a distant object moves toward the eye, the number of parasympathetic impulses impinging on the ciliary muscle must be progressively increased for the eye to keep the object constantly in focus. Sympathetic stimu- lation has an additional effect in relaxing the ciliary muscle, but this effect is so weak that it plays almost no role in the normal accommodation mechanism; the neurophysiology of this mechanism is discussed in Chapter 52.",
          "Presbyopia—Loss of Accommodation by the Lens. As a person grows older, the lens grows larger and thicker and becomes far less elastic, partly because of progressive denaturation of the lens proteins. The ability of the lens to change shape decreases with age. The power of accom- modation decreases from about 14 diopters in a child to less than 2 diopters by the time a person reaches 45 to 50 years and to essentially 0 diopters at age 70 years. There- after, the lens remains almost totally nonaccommodating, a condition known as presbyopia.",
          "Once a person has reached the state of presbyopia, each eye remains focused permanently at an almost con- stant distance; this distance depends on the physical char- acteristics of each person’s eyes. The eyes can no longer accommodate for both near and far vision. To see clearly both in the distance and nearby, an older person must wear bifocal glasses, with the upper segment focused for far-seeing and the lower segment focused for near-seeing (e.g., for reading)."

          "The major function of the iris is to increase the amount of light that enters the eye during darkness and to decrease the amount of light that enters the eye in daylight. The reflexes for controlling this mechanism are considered in Chapter 52.",
          "The amount of light that enters the eye through the pupil is proportional to the area of the pupil or to the square of the diameter of the pupil. The pupil of the human eye can become as small as about 1.5 millimeters and as large as 8 millimeters in diameter. The quantity of light entering the eye can change about 30-fold as a result of changes in pupillary aperture.",
          "“Depth of Focus” of the Lens System Increases With Decreasing Pupillary Diameter. Figure 50-11 shows two eyes that are exactly alike except for the diameters of the pupillary apertures. In the upper eye, the pupillary aper- ture is small and, in the lower eye, the aperture is large. In front of each of these two eyes are two small point sources of light; light from each passes through the pupillary aper- ture and focuses on the retina. Consequently, in both eyes, the retina sees two spots of light in perfect focus. If the retina is moved forward or backward to an out of focus po- sition (dashed lines), the size of each spot will not change much in the upper eye, but in the lower eye the size of each spot will increase greatly, becoming a “blur circle? In other words, the upper lens system has far greater depth of focus than the bottom lens system. When a lens system has great depth of focus, the retina can be displaced consider- ably from the focal plane, or the lens strength can change considerably from normal, and the image will still remain nearly in sharp focus, whereas when a lens system has a “shallow” depth of focus, moving the retina only slightly away from the focal plane causes extreme blurring.",
          "The greatest possible depth of focus occurs when the pupil is extremely small. The reason for this is that with a very small aperture, almost all the rays pass through the center of the lens, and the central most rays are always in focus, as explained earlier."

As shown in Figure 50-12, the eye is considered to be normal, or emmetropic, if parallel light rays from distant objects are in sharp focus on the retina when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed. This means that the emmetropic eye can see all distant objects clearly with its ciliary muscle relaxed. However, to focus objects at close range, the eye must contract its ciliary muscle and thereby provide an appropriate degree of accommodation.",
          "Hyperopia (Farsightedness). Hyperopia, also known as “farsightedness,’ is usually due to either an eyeball that is too short or, occasionally, to a lens system that is too weak. In this condition, as seen in the middle panel of Figure 50-12, parallel light rays are not bent sufficiently by the relaxed lens system to come to focus by the time they reach the retina. To overcome this abnormality, the ciliary muscle must contract to increase the strength of the lens. By us- ing the mechanism of accommodation, a farsighted person is capable of focusing distant objects on the retina. If the person has used only a small amount of strength in the cili- ary muscle to accommodate for the distant objects, he or she still has much accommodative power left, and objects closer and closer to the eye can also be focused sharply un- til the ciliary muscle has contracted to its limit. In old age, when the lens becomes “presbyopic,’ a farsighted person is often unable to accommodate the lens sufficiently to focus even on distant objects, much less on near objects.",
          "Myopia (Nearsightedness). In myopia, or “nearsight- edness,’ when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed, the light rays coming from distant objects are focused in front of the retina, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 50-12. This condition is usually due to too long an eyeball but also can result from too much refractive power in the lens sys- tem of the eye.",
          "No mechanism exists whereby the eye can decrease the strength of its lens to less than that which exists when the ciliary muscle is completely relaxed. A myopic person has no mechanism to focus distant objects sharply on the reti- na. However, as an object moves nearer to the person's eye, it finally gets close enough that its image can be focused. Then, when the object comes still closer to the eye, the per- son can use the mechanism of accommodation to keep the image focused clearly. A myopic person has a definite limit- ing “far point” for clear vision.",
          "Correction of Myopia and Hyperopia Through Use of Lenses. If the refractive surfaces of the eye have too much refractive power, as in myopia, this excessive refractive power can be neutralized by placing a concave spherical lens in front of the eye, which will diverge rays. Such cor- rection is shown in the upper diagram of Figure 50-13.",
          "Conversely, in a person who has hyperopia—that is, someone who has too weak a lens system—the abnormal vision can be corrected by adding refractive power using a convex lens in front of the eye. This correction is demon- strated in the lower diagram of Figure 50-13.",

          "Astigmatism. Astigmatism is a refractive error of the eye that causes the visual image in one plane to focus at a different distance from that of the plane at right angles. Astigmatism usually results from too great a curvature of the cornea in one plane of the eye. An example of an astig- matic lens would be a lens surface like that of an egg lying sidewise to the incoming light. The degree of curvature in the plane through the long axis of the egg is not nearly as great as the degree of curvature in the plane through the short axis.",
          "Because the curvature of the astigmatic lens along one plane is less than the curvature along the other plane, light rays striking the peripheral portions of the lens in one plane are not bent nearly as much as the rays striking the periph- eral portions of the other plane. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 50-14, which shows rays of light originating from a point source and passing through an oblong, astigmatic lens. The light rays in the vertical plane, indicated by plane BD, are refracted greatly by the astigmatic lens because of the greater curvature in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction. By contrast, the light rays in the hori- zontal plane, indicated by plane AC, are not bent nearly as much as the light rays in vertical plane BD. Therefore, light rays passing through an astigmatic lens do not all come toa common focal point because the light rays passing through one plane focus far in front of those passing through the other plane.",
          "The accommodative power of the eye can never com- pensate for astigmatism because, during accommodation, the curvature of the eye lens changes approximately equally in both planes; therefore, in astigmatism, each of the two planes requires a different degree of accommodation. Thus, without the aid of glasses, a person with astigmatism never sees in sharp focus.",
          "Correction of Astigmatism With a Cylindrical Lens. One may consider an astigmatic eye as having a lens system made up of two cylindrical lenses of different strengths and placed at right angles to each other. To correct for astigma- tism, the usual procedure is to find a spherical lens by trial and error that corrects the focus in one of the two planes of the astigmatic lens. Then, an additional cylindrical lens is used to correct the remaining error in the remaining plane. To do this, both the axis and the strength of the required cylindrical lens must be determined.",
          "Several methods exist for determining the axis of the abnormal cylindrical component of the lens system of an eye. One of these methods is based on the use of paral- lel black bars of the type shown in Figure 50-15. Some of these parallel bars are vertical, some are horizontal, and some are at various angles to the vertical and horizontal axes. After placing various spherical lenses in front of the astigmatic eye, a strength of lens that causes sharp focus of one set of parallel bars but does not correct the fuzziness of the set of bars at right angles to the sharp bars is usually found. It can be shown from the physical principles of op- tics discussed earlier in this chapter that the axis of the out of focus cylindrical component of the optical system is par- allel to the bars that are fuzzy. Once this axis is found, the examiner tries progressively stronger and weaker positive or negative cylindrical lenses, the axes of which are placed in line with the out of focus bars, until the patient sees all the crossed bars with equal clarity. When this goal has been accomplished, the examiner directs the optician to grind a special lens combining both the spherical correction and the cylindrical correction at the appropriate axis.",
          "Correction of Optical Abnormalities With Contact Lenses. Glass or plastic contact lenses that fit snugly against the anterior surface of the cornea can be inserted. These lenses are held in place by a thin layer of tear fluid that fills the space between the contact lens and the anterior eye surface.",
          "A special feature of the contact lens is that it nullifies the re- fraction that normally occurs at the anterior surface of the cor- nea almost entirely. The reason for this nullification is that the tears between the contact lens and the cornea have a refractive index almost equal to that of the cornea, so the anterior surface of the cornea no longer plays a significant role in the eye's opti- cal system. Instead, the outer surface of the contact lens plays the major role. Thus, the refraction of this surface of the con- tact lens substitutes for the cornea’s usual refraction. This factor is especially important in people whose eye refractive errors are caused by an abnormally shaped cornea, such as those who have an odd-shaped, bulging cornea, a condition called kera- toconus. Without the contact lens, the bulging cornea causes such severe abnormality of vision that almost no glasses can correct the vision satisfactorily; when a contact lens is used, however, the corneal refraction is neutralized, and normal re- fraction by the outer surface of the contact lens is substituted.",
          "The contact lens has several other advantages as well, including the following: (1) the lens turns with the eye and gives a broader field of clear vision than glasses; and (2) the contact lens has little effect on the size of the object the person sees through the lens, whereas lenses placed about 1 centimeter in front of the eye do affect the size of the image in addition to correcting the focus.",
          "Cataracts—Opaque Areas in the Lens. “Cataracts” are an especially common eye abnormality that occurs mainly in older people. A cataract is a cloudy or opaque area (or areas) in the lens. In the early stage of cataract formation, the proteins in some of the lens fibers become denatured. Later, these same proteins coagulate to form opaque areas in place of the normal transparent protein fibers.",
          "When a cataract has obscured light transmission so greatly that it seriously impairs vision, the condition can be corrected by surgical removal of the lens. When the lens is removed, the eye loses a large portion of its refractive pow- er, which must be replaced by placing a powerful convex lens in front of the eye; usually, however, an artificial plastic lens is implanted in the eye in place of the removed lens."

However, because the lens system of the eye is never perfect, such a retinal spot ordinarily has a total diameter of about 11 micrometers, even with maximal resolution of the normal eye optical system. The spot is brightest in its center and shades off gradually toward the edges, as shown by the two-point images in Figure 50-16.",
          "The average diameter of the cones in the fovea of the ret- ina—the central part of the retina, where vision is most highly developed—is about 1.5 micrometers, which is one-seventh the diameter of the spot of light. Nevertheless, because the spot of light has a bright center point and shaded edges, a person can normally distinguish two separate points if their centers lie up to 2 micrometers apart on the retina, which is slightly greater than the width of a foveal cone. This discrimi- nation between points is also shown in Figure 50-16.",
          "The normal visual acuity of the human eye for discrim- inating between point sources of light is about 25 seconds of arc. That is, when light rays from two separate points strike the eye with an angle of at least 25 seconds between them, they can usually be recognized as two points instead of one. This means that a person with normal visual acu- ity looking at two bright pinpoint spots of light 10 meters away can barely distinguish the spots as separate entities when they are 1.5 to 2 millimeters apart.",
          "The fovea is less than 0.5 millimeter (<500 microme- ters) in diameter, which means that maximum visual acu- ity occurs in less than 2 degrees of the visual field. Outside this foveal area, the visual acuity becomes progressively poorer, decreasing more than 10-fold as the periphery is approached. This is caused by the connection of more and more rods and cones to each optic nerve fiber in the non- foveal, more peripheral parts of the retina, as discussed in Chapter 52.",
          "Clinical Method for Stating Visual Acuity. The chart for testing eyes usually consists of letters of different siz- es placed 20 feet away from the person being tested. If the person can see well the letters of a size that he or she should be able to see at 20 feet, the person is said to have 20/20 vision—that is, normal vision. If the person can see only letters that he or she should be able to see at 200 feet, the person is said to have 20/200 vision. In other words, the clinical method for expressing visual acuity is to use a mathematical fraction that expresses the ratio of two dis- tances, which is also the ratio of a person’s visual acuity to that of a person with normal visual acuity."

          "Determination of Distance by Sizes of Retinal Images of Known Objects. If one knows that a person being viewed is 6 feet tall, one can determine how far away the person is simply by the size of the person's image on the retina. One does not consciously think about the size, but the brain has learned to calculate automatically from image sizes the dis- tances of objects when the dimensions are known.",
          "Determination of Distance by Moving Parallax. Anoth- er important means whereby the eyes determine distance is that of moving parallax, a displacement in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight. If a person looks off into the distance with the eyes completely still, he or she perceives no moving parallax, but when the person moves the head to one side or the other, the images of nearby objects move rapidly across the reti- nas, whereas the images of distant objects remain almost completely stationary. For example, by moving the head 1 inch to the side when the object is only 1 inch in front of the eye, the image moves almost all the way across the retinas, whereas the image of an object 200 feet away from the eyes does not move perceptibly. Thus, by using this mechanism of moving parallax, one can tell the relative distances of dif- ferent objects even though only one eye is used.",
          "Determination of Distance by Stereopsis—Binocular Vision. Another method whereby one perceives parallax is that of binocular vision. Because one eye is a little more than 2 inches to one side of the other eye, the images on the two retinas are different from each other. For example, an object 1 inch in front of the nose forms an image on the left side of the retina of the left eye but on the right side of the retina of the right eye, whereas a small object 20 feet in front of the nose has its image at closely corresponding points in the centers of the two retinas. This type of parallax is demonstrated in Figure 50-17, which shows the images of a red spot and a yellow square actually reversed on the two retinas because they are at different distances in front of the eyes. This gives a type of parallax that is always present when both eyes are being used. It is almost entirely this binocular parallax (or ste- reopsis) that gives a person with two eyes far greater ability to judge relative distances when objects are nearby than a person who has only one eye. However, stereopsis is virtually useless for depth perception at distances beyond 50 to 200 feet."

Essentially all of it is secreted by the ciliary processes, which are linear folds projecting from the ciliary body into the space behind the iris where the lens ligaments and ciliary muscle attach to the eyeball. A cross section of these ciliary processes is shown in Fig- ure 50-19, and their relation to the fluid chambers of the eye can be seen in Figure 50-18. Because of their folded architecture, the total surface area of the ciliary processes is about 6 square centimeters in each eye—a large area, considering the small size of the ciliary body. The surfaces of these processes are covered by highly secretory epithelial cells, and immediately beneath them is a highly vascular area.",
          "Aqueous humor is formed almost entirely as an active secretion by the epithelium of the ciliary processes. Secre- tion begins with active transport of sodium ions into the spaces between the epithelial cells. The sodium ions pull chloride and bicarbonate ions along with them to main- tain electrical neutrality. Then, all these ions together cause osmosis of water from the blood capillaries lying below into the same epithelial intercellular spaces; the resulting solution washes from the spaces of the ciliary processes into the anterior chamber of the eye. In addi- tion, several nutrients are transported across the epithe- lium by active transport or facilitated diffusion, including amino acids, ascorbic acid, and glucose."

From here, the fluid flows anterior to the lens and into the angle between the cornea and the iris, then through a meshwork of trabeculae, and finally entering the canal of Schlemm, which empties into extra- ocular veins. Figure 50-20 demonstrates the anatomical structures at this iridocorneal angle, showing that the spaces between the trabeculae extend all the way from the anterior chamber to the canal of Schlemm. The canal of Schlemm is a thin-walled vein that extends circumferentially all the way around the eye. Its endothelial membrane is so porous that even large protein molecules, as well as small particulate mat- ter up to the size of red blood cells, can pass from the anterior chamber into the canal of Schlemm. Even though the canal of Schlemm is actually a venous blood vessel, so much aqueous humor normally flows into it that it is filled only with aqueous humor rather than with blood. The small veins that lead from the canal of Schlemm to the larger veins of the eye usually contain only aqueous humor; they are called aqueous veins."

Because it is impractical to pass a needle into a patient’s eye to measure intraocular pressure, this pressure is measured clinically by using a “tonometer,” the principle of which is shown in Figure 50-21. The cornea of the eye is anes- thetized with a local anesthetic, and the footplate of the tonometer is placed on the cornea. A small force is then applied to a central plunger, causing the part of the cornea beneath the plunger to be displaced inward. The amount of displacement is recorded on the scale of the tonometer, and this is calibrated in terms of intraocular pressure.",
          "Regulation of Intraocular Pressure. Intraocular pres- sure remains constant in the normal eye, usually within +2 mm Hg of its normal level, which averages about 15 mm Hg. The level of this pressure is determined mainly by the resistance to outflow of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the canal of Schlemm. This outflow resist- ance results from the meshwork of trabeculae through which the fluid must percolate on its way from the lateral angles of the anterior chamber to the wall of the canal of Schlemm. These trabeculae have minute openings of only 2 to 3 micrometers. The rate of fluid flow into the canal increases markedly as the pressure rises. At about 15 mm Hg in the normal eye, the amount of fluid leaving the eye via the canal of Schlemm usually averages 2.5 yl/min and equals the inflow of fluid from the ciliary body. The pres- sure normally remains at about this level of 15 mm Hg.",
          "Mechanism for Cleansing the Trabecular Spaces and Intraocular Fluid. When large amounts of debris are present in the aqueous humor, as occurs after hemorrhage into the eye or during intraocular infection, the debris is likely to accumu- late in the trabecular spaces leading from the anterior cham- ber to the canal of Schlemm; this debris can prevent adequate reabsorption of fluid from the anterior chamber, sometimes causing “glaucoma, as explained subsequently. However, on the surfaces of the trabecular plates are large numbers of phagocytic cells. Immediately outside the canal of Schlemm is a layer of interstitial gel that contains large numbers of reticu- loendothelial cells that have an extremely high capacity for en- gulfing debris and digesting it into small molecular substances that can then be absorbed. Thus, this phagocytic system keeps the trabecular spaces cleaned. The surface of the iris and other surfaces of the eye behind the iris are covered with an epithe- lium that can phagocytize proteins and small particles from the aqueous humor, thereby helping maintain a clear fluid.",
          "“Glaucoma” Causes High Intraocular Pressure and Is a Principal Cause of Blindness. Glaucoma, one of the most common causes of blindness, is a disease of the eye in which the intraocular pressure becomes pathologically high, sometimes rising acutely to 60 to 70 mm Hg. Pres- sures above 25 to 30 mm Hg can cause loss of vision when maintained for long periods. Extremely high pressures can cause blindness within days or even hours. As the pressure rises, the axons of the optic nerve are compressed where they leave the eyeball at the optic disc. This compression is believed to block axonal flow of cytoplasm from the retinal neuronal cell bodies into the optic nerve fibers leading to the brain. The result is lack of appropriate nutrition of the fibers, which eventually causes death of the involved fibers. It is possible that compression of the retinal artery, which enters the eyeball at the optic disc, also adds to the neu- ronal damage by reducing nutrition to the retina.",
          "In most cases of glaucoma, the abnormally high pressure results from increased resistance to fluid outflow through the trabecular spaces into the canal of Schlemm at the iri- docorneal junction. For example, in acute eye inflammation, white blood cells and tissue debris can block these trabecular spaces and cause an acute increase in intraocular pressure. In chronic conditions, especially in older persons, fibrous occlu- sion of the trabecular spaces appears to be the likely culprit.",
          "Glaucoma can sometimes be treated by placing drops in the eye that contain a drug that diffuses into the eyeball and reduces the secretion or increases the absorption of aque- ous humor. When drug therapy fails, operative techniques to open the spaces of the trabeculae or make channels to al- low fluid to flow directly from the fluid space of the eyeball into the subconjunctival space outside the eyeball can often reduce the pressure effectively."

After light passes through the lens system of the eye and then through the vitreous humor, it enters the retina from the inside of the eye (see Figure 51-1); that is, it passes first through the ganglion cells and then through the plexiform and nuclear layers before it finally reaches the layer of rods and cones located all the way on the outer edge of the ret- ina. This distance is a thickness of several hundred microm- eters; visual acuity is decreased by this passage through such nonhomogeneous tissue. However, in the central foveal region of the retina, as discussed subsequently, the inside layers are pulled aside to decrease this loss of acuity.",

The central fovea, only 0.3 millimeter in di- ameter, is composed almost entirely of cones. These cones have a special structure that aids their detection of detail in the visual image—that is, the foveal cones have especially long and slender bodies, in contradistinction to the much fatter cones located more peripherally in the retina. Also, in the foveal region, the blood vessels, ganglion cells, inner nuclear layer of cells, and plexiform layers are all displaced to one side rather than resting directly on top of the cones, which allows light to pass unimpeded to the cones.",

The concentrations of these photosensitive pigments in the discs are so great that the pigments themselves constitute about 40% of the entire mass of the outer segment.",
          "The inner segment of the rod or cone contains the usual cytoplasm, with cytoplasmic organelles. Especially important are the mitochondria, which, as explained later, play the important role of providing energy for function of the photoreceptors.",
          "The synaptic body is the portion of the rod or cone that connects with subsequent neuronal cells, the horizontal and bipolar cells, which represent the next stages in the vision chain.",
          "Pigment Layer of the Retina. The black pigment mela- nin in the pigment layer prevents light reflection through- out the globe of the eyeball, which is extremely important for clear vision. This pigment performs the same function in the eye as the black coloring inside the bellows of a camera. Without it, light rays would be reflected in all di- rections in the eyeball and would cause diffuse lighting of the retina rather than the normal contrast between dark and light spots required to form precise images.",
          "The importance of melanin in the pigment layer is well illustrated by its absence in people with albinism (congen- ital absence of melanin pigment in all parts of their bod- ies). When a person with albinism enters a bright room, light that impinges on the retina is reflected in all direc- tions inside the eyeball by the unpigmented surfaces of the retina and by the underlying sclera, so a single discrete spot of light that would normally excite only a few rods or cones is reflected everywhere and excites many receptors. Therefore, the visual acuity of people with albinism, even with the best optical correction, is seldom better than 20/100 to 20/200 rather than the normal 20/20 values.",
          "The pigment layer also stores large quantities of vitamin A. This vitamin A is exchanged back and forth through the cell membranes of the outer segments of the rods and cones, which are embedded in the pigment. We discuss later that vitamin A is an important precursor of the photosensitive chemicals of the rods and cones.",
          "Blood Supply of the Retina—The Central Retinal Artery and the Choroid. The nutrient blood supply for the internal layers of the retina is derived from the central retinal artery, which enters the eyeball through the center of the optic nerve and then divides to supply the entire inside retinal surface. Thus, the inner layers of the retina have their own blood supply, independent of the other structures of the eye.",
          "However, the outermost layer of the retina is adherent to the choroid, which is also a highly vascular tissue lying between the retina and the sclera. The outer layers of the retina, especially the outer segments of the rods and cones, depend mainly on diffusion from the choroid blood vessels for their nutrition, especially for their oxygen.",
          "Retinal Detachment. The neural retina occasionally de- taches from the pigment epithelium. In some cases, the cause of such detachment is injury to the eyeball that allows fluid or blood to collect between the neural retina and the pigment epithelium. Detachment is occasionally caused by contrac- ture of fine collagenous fibrils in the vitreous humor, which pull areas of the retina toward the interior of the globe.",
          "Partly because of diffusion across the detachment gap, and partly because of the independent blood supply to the neural retina through the retinal artery, the detached retina can resist degeneration for days and can become functional again if it is surgically replaced in its normal relation with the pigment epithelium. If it is not replaced soon, however, the retina will be destroyed and will be unable to function, even after surgical repair."

          "Rhodopsin and Its Decomposition by Light Energy. The outer segment of the rod that projects into the pigment layer of the retina has a concentration of about 40% of the light-sensitive pigment called rhodopsin, or visual purple. This substance is a combination of the protein scotopsin and the carotenoid pigment retinal (also called “retinene’). Furthermore, the retinal is a particular type called 11-cis retinal. This cis form of retinal is important because only this form can bind with scotopsin to synthesize rhodopsin.",
          "When light energy is absorbed by rhodopsin, the rho- dopsin begins to decompose within a very small fraction of a second, as shown at the top of Figure 51-5. The cause of this rapid decomposition is photoactivation of elec- trons in the retinal portion of the rhodopsin, which leads to instantaneous change of the cis form of retinal into an all-trans form that has the same chemical structure as the cis form but a different physical structure—it is a straight molecule rather than an angulated molecule. Because the three-dimensional orientation of the reactive sites of the all-trans retinal no longer fits with the orientation of the reactive sites on the protein scotopsin, the all-trans retinal begins to pull away from the scotopsin. The immediate product is bathorhodopsin, which is a partially split com- bination of the all-trans retinal and scotopsin. Bathorho- dopsin is extremely unstable and decays in nanoseconds to lumirhodopsin. This product then decays in microsec- onds to metarhodopsin I, then in about a millisecond to metarhodopsin II, and finally, much more slowly (in sec- onds), into the completely split products scotopsin and all- trans retinal.",
          "It is the metarhodopsin I, also called activated rho- dopsin, that excites electrical changes in the rods, and the rods then transmit the visual image into the central ner- vous system in the form of optic nerve action potentials, as we discuss later.",
          "Re-Formation of Rhodopsin. The first stage in re- formation of rhodopsin, as shown in Figure 51-5, is to reconvert the all-trans retinal into 11-cis retinal. This pro- cess requires metabolic energy and is catalyzed by the en- zyme retinal isomerase. Once the 11-cis retinal is formed, it automatically recombines with the scotopsin to re-form rhodopsin, which then remains stable until its decompo- sition is again triggered by absorption of light energy.",
          "Role of Vitamin A for Formation of Rhodopsin. Note in Figure 51-5 that there is a second chemical route whereby all-trans retinal can be converted into 11-cis retinal. This second route is by conversion of the all-trans retinal first into all-trans retinol, which is one form of vi- tamin A. Then, the all-trans retinol is converted into 11- cis retinol under the influence of the enzyme isomerase. Finally, the 11-cis retinol is converted into 11-cis retinal, which combines with scotopsin to form new rhodopsin.",
          "Vitamin A is present both in the cytoplasm of the rods and in the pigment layer of the retina. Therefore, vitamin A is normally always available to form new retinal when needed. Conversely, when there is excess retinal in the retina, it is converted back into vitamin A, thus reducing the amount of light-sensitive pigment in the retina. We shall see later that this interconversion between retinal and vitamin A is especially important in long-term adap- tation of the retina to different light intensities.",
          "Night Blindness Due to Vitamin A Deficiency. Night blindness occurs in persons with severe vitamin A defi- ciency because, without vitamin A, the amounts of retinal and rhodopsin that can be formed are severely depressed. This condition is called night blindness because the amount of light available at night is too little to permit adequate vi- sion in vitamin A—deficient persons.",
          "For night blindness to occur, a person usually must re- main on a vitamin A—deficient diet for months, because large quantities of vitamin A are normally stored in the liver and can be made available to the eyes. Once night blindness develops, it can sometimes be reversed in less than 1 hour by intravenous injection of vitamin A."

          "The Rod Receptor Hyperpolarizes in Response to Light. Exposure of the rod to light causes increased nega- tivity of the intrarod membrane potential, which is a state of hyperpolarization. This is exactly opposite to the de- creased negativity (the process of “depolarization”) that occurs in almost all other sensory receptors.",
          "How does activation of rhodopsin cause hyperpolar- ization? The answer is that when rhodopsin decomposes, it decreases the rod membrane conductance for sodium ions in the outer segment of the rod causing hyperpolarization.",
          "Figure 51-6 shows movement of sodium and potas- sium ions in a complete electrical circuit through the inner and outer segments of the rod. The inner segment continually pumps sodium from inside the rod to the out- side, and potassium ions are pumped to the inside of the cell. Potassium ions leak out of the cell through nongated potassium channels that are confined to the inner segment of the rod. As in other cells, this sodium-potassium pump creates a negative potential on the inside of the entire cell. However, the outer segment of the rod, where the pho- toreceptor discs are located, is entirely different. Here, the rod membrane, in the dark state, is leaky to sodium ions that flow through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-~gated channels. In the dark state, cGMP levels are high, permitting positively charged sodium ions to continually leak back to the inside of the rod and thereby neutralize much of the negativity on the inside of the entire cell. Thus, under normal dark conditions, when the rod is not excited, there is reduced electronegativity inside the membrane of the rod, measuring about —40 millivolts rather than the usual —70 to —80 millivolts found in most sensory receptors.",

Potassium flows out of the cell through nongated potassium chan- nels. A sodium-potassium pump maintains steady levels of sodium and potassium inside the cell. B, In the dark, cGMP levels are high, and the sodium channels are open. In the light, cGMP levels are re- duced and the sodium channels close, causing the cell to hyperpolar- ize. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate.",
          "Figure 51-7. Phototransduction in the outer segment of the photo- receptor (rod or cone) membrane. When light hits the photoreceptor (e.g., arod cell), the light-absorbing retinal portion of rhodopsin is ac- tivated. This activation stimulates transducin, a G protein, which then activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiester- ase. This enzyme catalyzes the degradation of cGMP into 5’-GMP. The reduction in cGMP then causes closure of the sodium channels, which, in turn, causes hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor.",
          "When the rhodopsin in the outer segment of the rod is exposed to light, it is activated and begins to decom- pose. The cGMP-gated sodium channels are then closed, and the outer segment membrane conductance of sodium to the interior of the rod is reduced by a three-step pro- cess (Figure 51-7): (1) light is absorbed by the rhodop- sin, causing photoactivation of the electrons in the retinal portion, as previously described; (2) the activated rho- dopsin stimulates a G protein called transducin, which then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of cGMP to 5’-GMP; and (3) the reduction in cGMP closes the cGMP-gated sodium chan- nels and reduces the inward sodium current. Sodium ions continue to be pumped outward through the membrane of the inner segment. Thus, more sodium ions now leave the rod than leak back in. Because they are positive ions, their loss from inside the rod creates increased negativity inside the membrane, and the greater the amount of light energy striking the rod, the greater the electronegativity becomes—that is, the greater is the degree of hyperpo- larization. At maximum light intensity, the membrane potential approaches —70 to —80 millivolts, which is near the equilibrium potential for potassium ions across the membrane.",
          "Duration of the Receptor Potential, and Logarithmic Relation of the Receptor Potential to Light Intensity. When a sudden pulse of light strikes the retina, the tran- sient hyperpolarization (receptor potential) that occurs in the rods reaches a peak in about 0.3 second and lasts for more than 1 second. In cones, the change occurs four times as fast as in the rods. A visual image impinged on the rods of the retina for only one-millionth of a second can sometimes cause the sensation of seeing the image for longer than 1 second.",
          "Another characteristic of the receptor potential is that it is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the light intensity. This characteristic is exceedingly impor- tant because it allows the eye to discriminate light inten- sities through a range many thousand times as great as would be possible otherwise.",
          "Mechanism Whereby Rhodopsin Decomposition De- creases Membrane Sodium Conductance—The Ex- citation “Cascade.” Under optimal conditions, a single photon of light, the smallest possible quantal unit of light energy, can cause a receptor potential of about 1 millivolt in a rod. Only 30 photons of light will cause half-saturation of the rod. How can such a small amount of light cause such great excitation? The answer is that the photoreceptors have an extremely sensitive chemical cascade that ampli- fies the stimulatory effects about a millionfold, as follows: 1. The photon activates an electron in the 11-cis retinal portion of the rhodopsin; this activation leads to the formation of metarhodopsin II, which is the active form of rhodopsin, as shown in Figure 51-5. 2. The activated rhodopsin functions as an enzyme to activate many molecules of transducin, a protein present in an inactive form in the membranes of the discs and cell membrane of the rod. 3. The activated transducin activates many more mol- ecules of phosphodiesterase. 4. Activated phosphodiesterase immediately hydrolyzes many molecules of cGMP, thus destroying it. Before being destroyed, the cGMP had been bound with the sodium channel protein of the rod’s outer membrane in a way that “splints” it in the open state. However, in light, hydrolyzation of the cGMP by phosphodies- terase removes the splinting and allows the sodium channels to close. Several hundred channels close for each originally activated molecule of rhodopsin. Be- cause the sodium flux through each of these channels has been extremely rapid, flow of more than 1 million sodium ions is blocked by the channel closure before the channel opens again. This diminution of sodium ion flow is what excites the rod, as already discussed. 5. Within about 1 second, another enzyme, rhodopsin kinase, which is always present in the rod, inactivates the activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II), and the entire cascade reverses back to the normal state with open sodium channels.",
          "Thus, the rods have developed an important chemi- cal cascade that amplifies the effect of a single photon of light to cause movement of millions of sodium ions. This mechanism explains the extreme sensitivity of the rods under dark conditions.",
          "The cones are about 30 to 300 times less sensitive than the rods, but even this degree of sensitivity allows color vision at any intensity of light greater than extremely dim twilight."

The only difference is that the protein portions, or the opsins—called photopsins in the cones—are slightly different from the scotopsin of the rods. The retinal portion of all the visual pigments is exactly the same in the cones and rods. The color-sensitive pigments of the cones, therefore, are combinations of retinal and photopsins.",
          "Only one of three types of color pigments is present in each of the different cones, thus making the cones selec- tively sensitive to different colors—blue, green, or red. These color pigments are called, respectively, blue-sensitive pigment, green-sensitive pigment, and red-sensitive pig- ment. The absorption characteristics of the pigments in the three types of cones show peak absorbencies at light wavelengths of 445, 535, and 570 nanometers, respectively. These wavelengths are also the wavelengths for peak light sensitivity for each type of cone, which begins to explain how the retina differentiates the colors. The approximate absorption curves for these three pigments are shown in Figure 51-8. Also shown is the absorption curve for the rhodopsin of the rods, with a peak at 505 nanometers.",

Furthermore, much of the retinal of both the rods and the cones will have been converted into vitamin A. Because of these two effects, the concentrations of the photosensitive chemicals remaining in the rods and cones are considerably reduced, and the sensitivity of the eye to light is correspondingly reduced. This process is called light adaptation.",
          "Conversely, if a person remains in darkness for a long time, the retinal and opsins in the rods and cones are con- verted back into the light-sensitive pigments. Furthermore, vitamin A is converted back into retinal to increase light- sensitive pigments, the final limit being determined by the amount of opsins in the rods and cones to combine with the retinal. This process is called dark adaptation.",
          "Figure 51-9 shows the course of dark adaptation when a person is exposed to total darkness after having been exposed to bright light for several hours. Note that the sensitivity of the retina is very low on first entering the darkness, but within 1 minute, the sensitivity has already increased 10-fold—that is, the retina can respond to light of one-tenth that of the previously required intensity. At the end of 20 minutes, the sensitivity has increased about 6000-fold and, at the end of 40 minutes, it has increased about 25,000-fold.",
          "The resulting curve of Figure 51-9 is called the dark adaptation curve. Note the inflection in the curve. The early portion of the curve is caused by adaptation of the cones because all the chemical events of vision, includ- ing adaptation, occur about four times as rapidly in cones as in rods. However, the cones do not achieve anywhere near the same degree of sensitivity change in darkness as the rods. Therefore, despite rapid adaptation, the cones cease adapting after only a few minutes, whereas the slowly adapting rods continue to adapt for many minutes and even hours, with their sensitivity increasing tremen- dously. Additional sensitivity of the rods is caused by neu- ronal signal convergence of 100 or more rods onto a single ganglion cell in the retina; these rods summate to increase their sensitivity, as discussed later in the chapter.",
          "Other Mechanisms of Light and Dark Adaptation. In addition to adaptation caused by changes in concentra- tions of rhodopsin or color photochemicals, the eye has two other mechanisms for light and dark adaptation. The first is a change in pupillary size, as discussed in Chapter 50. This change can cause adaptation of approximately 30- fold within a fraction of a second because of changes in the amount of light allowed through the pupillary opening.",
          "the other mechanism is neural adaptation, involving the neurons in the successive stages of the visual chain in the retina and in the brain. That is, when light intensity first increases, the signals transmitted by the bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells are all intense. However, most of these signals decrease rapidly at different stages of transmission in the neural circuit. Al- though the degree of adaptation is only a fewfold rather than the many thousandfold that occurs during adaptation of the photochemical system, neural adaptation occurs in a fraction of a second, in contrast to the many minutes to hours required for full adaptation by the photochemicals.",
          "Value of Light and Dark Adaptation in Vision. Be- tween the limits of maximal dark adaptation and maximal light adaptation, the eye can change its sensitivity to light as much as 500,000 to 1 million times, with the sensitivity automatically adjusting to changes in illumination.",
          "Because registration of images by the retina requires detection of both dark and light spots in the image, it is essential that the sensitivity of the retina always be adjusted so that the receptors respond to the lighter areas but not to the darker areas. An example of maladjust- ment of retinal adaptation occurs when a person leaves a movie theater and enters the bright sunlight. Then, even the dark spots in the images seem exceedingly bright, and as a consequence, the entire visual image is bleached, with little contrast among its different parts. This poor vision remains until the retina has adapted sufficiently so that the darker areas of the image no longer stimulate the receptors excessively.",
          "Conversely, when a person first enters darkness, the sensitivity of the retina is usually so slight that even the light spots in the image cannot excite the retina. After dark adaptation, the light spots begin to register. As an example of the extremes of light and dark adaptation, the intensity of sunlight is about 10 billion times that of star- light, yet the eye can function both in bright sunlight after light adaptation and in starlight after dark adaptation."

Thus, for pure rod vision, there are four neurons in the direct visual pathway: (1) rods; (2) bipolar cells; (3) amacrine cells; and (4) ganglion cells. In addition, horizontal and amacrine cells provide lateral connectivity.",

The transmitters of the bipolar, horizontal, and interplexiform cells are unclear, but at least some of the horizontal cells release inhibitory transmitters.",
          "Transmission of Most Signals Occurs in the Retinal Neurons by Electrotonic Conduction, Not by Action Potentials. The only retinal neurons that always transmit visual signals via action potentials are the ganglion cells, and they send their signals all the way to the brain through the optic nerve. Occasionally, action potentials have also been recorded in amacrine cells, although the importance of these action potentials is questionable. Otherwise, all the retinal neurons conduct their visual signals by electro- tonic conduction, not by action potentials.",
          "Electrotonic conduction means direct flow of electric current, not action potentials, in the neuronal cytoplasm and nerve axons from the point of excitation all the way to the output synapses. Even in the rods and cones, con- duction from their outer segments to the synaptic bodies is by electrotonic conduction. That is, when hyperpolar- ization occurs in response to light in the outer segment of a rod or a cone, almost the same degree of hyperpo- larization is conducted by direct electric current flow in the cytoplasm all the way to the synaptic body, and no action potential is required. Then, when the transmitter from a rod or cone stimulates a bipolar cell or horizontal cell, once again the signal is transmitted from the input to the output by direct electric current flow, not by action potentials.",
          "The importance of electrotonic conduction is that it allows graded conduction of signal strength. Thus, for the rods and cones, the strength of the hyperpolarizing out- put signal is directly related to the intensity of illumina- tion; the signal is not all or none, as would be the case for each action potential."

          "The horizontal cells, shown in Figure 51-12, connect lat- erally between the synaptic bodies of the rods and cones and with the dendrites of the bipolar cells. The outputs of the horizontal cells are always inhibitory. Therefore, this lateral connection provides the same phenomenon of lateral inhibition that is important in other sensory sys- tems—that is, helping to ensure transmission of visual patterns with proper visual contrast. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 51-13, which shows a min- ute spot of light focused on the retina. The visual path- way from the central most area where the light strikes is excited, whereas an area to the side is inhibited. In other words, instead of the excitatory signal spreading widely in the retina because of spreading dendritic and axonal trees in the plexiform layers, transmission through the hori- zontal cells puts a stop to this spread by providing lateral inhibition in the surrounding areas. This process is essen- tial to allow high visual accuracy in transmitting contrast borders in the visual image.",

          "There are two possible explanations for this difference. One explanation is that the two bipolar cells are of entirely different types, with one responding by depolarizing in response to the glutamate neurotransmitter released by the rods and cones and the other responding by hyper- polarizing. The other possibility is that one of the bipolar cells receives direct excitation from the rods and cones, whereas the other receives its signal indirectly through a horizontal cell. Because the horizontal cell is an inhibi- tory cell, this would reverse the polarity of the electrical response.",
          "Regardless of the mechanism for the two types of bipo- lar responses, the importance of this phenomenon is that it allows half the bipolar cells to transmit positive signals and the other half to transmit negative signals. We shall see later that both positive and negative signals are used in transmitting visual information to the brain.",
          "Another important aspect of this reciprocal relation between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells is that it provides a second mechanism for lateral inhi- bition, in addition to the horizontal cell mechanism. Because depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells lie immediately against each other, this provides a mecha- nism for separating contrast borders in the visual image, even when the border lies exactly between two adjacent photoreceptors. In contrast, the horizontal cell mecha- nism for lateral inhibition operates over a much greater distance."

As one approaches the fovea, fewer rods and cones converge on each optic fiber, and the rods and cones also become more slender. These effects progressively increase the acuity of vision in the central retina. In the central fovea, there are only slen- der cones—about 35,000 of them—and no rods. Also, the number of optic nerve fibers leading from this part of the retina is almost exactly equal to the number of cones, as shown at the right in Figure 51-12. This phe- nomenon explains the high degree of visual acuity in the central retina in comparison with the much poorer acuity peripherally.",
          "Another difference between the peripheral and central portions of the retina is the much greater sensitivity of the peripheral retina to weak light, which occurs partly because rods are 30 to 300 times more sensitive to light than cones. However, this greater sensitivity is further magnified by the fact that as many as 200 rods converge on a single optic nerve fiber in the more peripheral por- tions of the retina, so signals from the rods summate to give even more intense stimulation of the peripheral gan- glion cells and their optic nerve fibers."

P-cell axons conduct impulses much more slowly than do M cells.  m 3. The responses of P cells to stimuli, especially color stimuli, can be sustained, whereas the responses of M cells are much more transient.  m 4.

The low- er tracing is from a ganglion cell located laterally to the spot of light; this cell is markedly inhibited when the light is turned on because of lateral inhibition. Then, when the light is turned off, opposite effects occur. The opposite directions of these responses to light are caused, respec- tively, by the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells, and the transient nature of the responses is probably at least partly generated by the amacrine cells, many of which have similar transient responses themselves.",

          "Many ganglion cells respond mainly to contrast borders in the scene, which seems to be the major means whereby the pattern of a scene is transmitted to the brain. When flat light is applied to the entire retina, and all the photo- receptors are stimulated equally by the incident light, the contrast type of ganglion cell is neither stimulated nor inhibited. The reason for this is that signals transmitted directly from the photoreceptors through depolarizing bipolar cells are excitatory, whereas the signals transmitted laterally through hyperpolarizing bipolar cells, as well as through horizontal cells, are mainly inhibitory. Thus, the direct excitatory signal through one pathway is likely to be neutralized by inhibitory signals through lateral path- ways. One circuit for this process is demonstrated in Fig- ure 51-15, which shows three photoreceptors at the top of the illustration. The central receptor excites a depolarizing bipolar cell. The two receptors on each side are connected to the same bipolar cell through inhibitory horizontal cells that neutralize the direct excitatory signal if all three recep- tors are stimulated simultaneously by light.",
          "Now, let us examine what happens when a contrast border occurs in the visual scene. Referring again to Figure 51-15, assume that the central photoreceptor is stimulated by a bright spot of light while one of the two lateral receptors is in the dark. The bright spot of light excites the direct pathway through the bipolar cell. The fact that one of the lateral photoreceptors is in the dark causes one of the horizontal cells to remain unstimulated. Therefore, this cell does not inhibit the bipolar cell, which allows extra excitation of the bipolar cell. Thus, where visual contrasts occur, the signals through the direct and lateral pathways accentuate one another.",

Therefore, the signal from the ganglion cell plays no role in the detection of different colors. Instead, it is a “white” signal.",

At the optic chiasm, the optic nerve fibers from the nasal halves of the retinas cross to the opposite sides, where they join the fibers from the opposite temporal retinas to form the optic tracts. The fibers of each optic tract then synapse in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and, from there, geniculocalcarine fibers pass via the optic radiation (also called the geniculocalcarine tract) to the primary visual cortex in the calcarine fissure area of the medial occipital lobe.",

The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus serves two principal functions. First, it relays visual information from the optic tract to the visual cortex by way of the optic radiation. This relay function is so accurate that there is exact point to point transmission with a high degree of spatial fidelity all the way from the retina to the visual cortex.",
          "After passing the optic chiasm, half the fibers in each optic tract are derived from one eye and half are derived from the other eye, representing corresponding points on the two retinas. However, the signals from the two eyes are kept apart in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This nucleus is composed of six nuclear layers. Layers II, III, and V (from ventral to dorsal) receive signals from the lat- eral half of the ipsilateral retina, whereas layers I, IV, and VI receive signals from the medial half of the retina of the opposite eye. The respective retinal areas of the two eyes connect with neurons that are superimposed over one another in the paired layers, and similar parallel transmis- sion is preserved all the way to the visual cortex. The second major function of the dorsal lateral genicu- late nucleus is to “gate” the transmission of signals to the visual cortex—that is, to control how much of the signal is allowed to pass to the cortex. The nucleus receives gating control signals from two major sources: (1) corticofugal fibers returning in a backward direction from the pri- mary visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus; and (2) reticular areas of the mesencephalon. Both of these sources are inhibitory and, when stimulated, can turn off transmission through selected portions of the dorsal lat- eral geniculate nucleus. Both of these gating circuits help highlight the visual information that is allowed to pass.",

These neurons re- ceive their input almost entirely from the large type M retinal ganglion cells. This magnocellular system provides a rapidly conducting pathway to the visual cortex. However, this system is color blind, trans- mitting only black-and-white information. Also, its point to point transmission is poor because there are not many M ganglion cells, and their dendrites spread widely in the retina. m 2. Layers III through VI are called parvocellular lay- ers because they contain large numbers of small to medium-sized neurons. These neurons receive their input almost entirely from the type P retinal ganglion cells that transmit color and convey accu- rate point to point spatial information, but at only a moderate velocity of conduction rather than at high velocity."

This cortical area deciphers whether the respective areas of the two visual images from the two separate eyes are “in register” with each other—that is, whether corresponding points from the two retinas fit with each other. In turn, the deciphered information is used to adjust the directional gaze of the separate eyes so that they will fuse with each other (ie., be brought into “register”).

Analysis of Third-Dimensional Position, Gross Form, and Motion of Objects. One of the analytical pathways, demonstrated in Figure 52-3 by the black arrows, analyzes the third-dimensional positions of visual objects in the space around the body. This path- way also analyzes the gross physical form of the visual scene, as well as motion in the scene. This pathway reveals where every object is during each instant and whether it is moving. After leaving the primary visual cortex, the signals flow generally into the posterior midtemporal area and upward into the broad occip- itoparietal cortex. At the anterior border of the pari- etal cortex, the signals overlap with signals from the posterior somatic association areas that analyze three- dimensional aspects of somatosensory signals. The signals transmitted in this position-form-motion path- way are mainly from the large M optic nerve fibers of the retinal M ganglion cells, transmitting rapid signals but depicting only black and white with no color. m 2.

The red arrows in Figure 52-3, passing from the primary visual cortex into secondary visual areas of the inferior, ventral, and medial regions of the occipital and temporal cortex, show the principal pathway for analysis of visual detail. Separate portions of this pathway specifically dissect out color as well. Therefore, this pathway is concerned with such visual feats as recognizing letters, reading, determining the texture of surfaces, determining de- tailed colors of objects, and deciphering from all this information what the object is and what it means."

          "Analysis of Contrasts in Visual Images. If a person looks at a blank wall, only a few neurons in the primary visual cortex will be stimulated, regardless of whether the illumination of the wall is bright or weak. Therefore, what does the primary visual cortex detect? To answer this question, let us now place on the wall a large solid cross, as shown to the left in Figure 52-5. To the right is shown the spatial pattern of the most excited neurons in the visual cortex. Note that the areas of maximum excitation occur along the sharp borders of the visual pattern. Thus, the visual signal in the primary visual cortex is concerned mainly with contrasts in the visual scene, rather than with noncontrasting areas. We noted in Chapter 51 that this is also true of most of the retinal ganglion because equally stimulated adjacent retinal receptors mutually inhibit one another. However, at any border in the visual scene where there is a change from dark to light or light to dark, mu- tual inhibition does not occur, and the intensity of stimu- lation of most neurons is proportional to the gradient of contrast—that is, the greater the sharpness of contrast and the greater the intensity difference between light and dark areas, the greater the degree of stimulation.",
          "Visual Cortex Also Detects Orientation of Lines and Borders—“Simple” Cells. The visual cortex detects not only the existence of lines and borders in the different ar- eas of the retinal image but also the direction of orienta- tion of each line or border—that is, whether it is vertical or horizontal or lies at some degree of inclination. This capability is believed to result from linear organizations of mutually inhibiting cells that excite second-order neu- rons when inhibition occurs all along a line of cells where there is a contrast edge. Thus, for each such orientation of a line, specific neuronal cells are stimulated. A line oriented in a different direction excites a different set of cells. These neuronal cells are called simple cells. They are found mainly in layer IV of the primary visual cortex.",
          "“Complex” Cells Detect Line Orientation When a Line Is Displaced Laterally or Vertically in the Visual Field. As the visual signal progresses farther away from layer IV, some neurons respond to lines that are oriented in the same direction but are not position-specific. That is, even if a line is displaced moderate distances laterally or vertically in the field, the same few neurons will still be stimulated if the line has the same direction. These cells are called complex cells.",
          "Detection of Lines of Specific Lengths, Angles, or Other Shapes. Some neurons in the outer layers of the primary visual columns, as well as neurons in some sec- ondary visual areas, are stimulated only by lines or bor- ders of specific lengths, by specific angulated shapes, or by images that have other characteristics. That is, these neurons detect still higher orders of information from the visual scene. Thus, as one goes farther into the analytical pathway of the visual cortex, progressively more charac- teristics of each visual scene are deciphered."

For example, a red area is often contrasted against a green area, a blue area against a red area, or a green area against a yellow area. All these colors can also be contrasted against a white area within the visual scene. In fact, this contrasting against white is believed to be mainly responsible for the phenom- enon called “color constancy’—that is, when the color of an illuminating light changes, the color of the “white” changes with the light, and appropriate computation in the brain allows red to be interpreted as red, even though the illuminating light has changed the color entering the eyes.",
          "The mechanism of color contrast analysis depends on the fact that contrasting colors, called “opponent colors,’ excite specific neuronal cells.

A small dot of light or a small object is then moved back and forth in all areas of the field of vision, and the subject indicates when the spot of light or object can and cannot be seen. The field of vision for the left eye is plotted as shown in Figure 52-6.

          "Perhaps the most important movements of the eyes are those that cause the eyes to “fix” on a discrete portion of the field of vision. Fixation movements are controlled by two neuronal mechanisms. The first of these mecha- nisms, called the voluntary fixation mechanism, allows a person to move the eyes voluntarily to find the object on which he or she wants to fix the vision. The second is the involuntary fixation mechanism that holds the eyes firmly on the object once it has been found.",
          "The voluntary fixation movements are controlled by a cortical field located bilaterally in the premotor corti- cal regions of the frontal lobes, as shown in Figure 52-8. Bilateral dysfunction or destruction of these areas makes it difficult for a person to “unlock” the eyes from one point of fixation and move them to another point. It is usually necessary to blink the eyes or put a hand over the eyes for a short time, which then allows the eyes to be moved.",
          "Conversely, the involuntary fixation mechanism that causes the eyes to “lock” on the object of attention once it is found is controlled by secondary visual areas in the occipital cortex, located mainly anterior to the primary visual cortex. When this fixation area is destroyed bilater- ally in an animal, the animal has difficulty keeping its eyes directed toward a given fixation point or may become totally unable to do so.",

          "To summarize, posterior “involuntary” occipital corti- cal eye fields automatically “lock” the eyes on a given spot of the visual field and thereby prevent movement of the image across the retinas. To unlock this visual fixation, voluntary signals must be transmitted from cortical “vol- untary” eye fields located in the frontal cortices.",
          "Mechanism of Involuntary Locking Fixation—Role of the Superior Colliculi. The involuntary locking type of fixation discussed in the previous section re- sults from a negative feedback mechanism that pre- vents the object of attention from leaving the foveal portion of the retina. The eyes normally have three types of continuous but almost imperceptible move- ments: (1) a continuous tremor at a rate of 30 to 80 cy- cles/sec caused by successive contractions of the motor units in the ocular muscles; (2) a slow drift of the eye- balls in one direction or another; and (3) sudden flick- ing movements that are controlled by the involuntary fixation mechanism.",
          "When a spot of light becomes fixed on the foveal region of the retina, the tremulous movements cause the spot to move back and forth at a rapid rate across the cones, and the drifting movements cause the spot to drift slowly across the cones. Each time the spot drifts as far as the edge of the fovea, a sudden reflex reaction occurs, producing a flicking movement that moves the spot away from this edge back toward the center of the fovea. Thus, an automatic response moves the image back toward the central point of vision.",
          "These drifting and flicking motions are demonstrated in Figure 52-9. The dashed lines show the slow drifting across the fovea, and the solid lines show the flicks that keep the image from leaving the foveal region. This invol- untary fixation capability is mostly lost when the superior colliculi are destroyed.",
          "Saccadic Movement of the Eyes—A Mechanism of Successive Fixation Points. When a visual scene is mov- ing continually before the eyes, such as when a person is riding in a car, the eyes fix on one highlight after another in the visual field, jumping from one to the next at a rate of two to three jumps per second. The jumps are called sac- cades, and the movements are called opticokinetic move- ments. The saccades occur so rapidly that no more than 10% of the total time is spent moving the eyes, with 90% of the time being allocated to the fixation sites. Also, the brain suppresses the visual image during saccades, so the person is not conscious of the movements from point to point.",
          "Saccadic Movements During Reading. During the process of reading, a person usually makes several sac- cadic movements of the eyes for each line. In this case, the visual scene is not moving past the eyes, but the eyes are trained to move by means of several successive saccades across the visual scene to extract the important informa- tion. Similar saccades occur when a person observes a painting, except that the saccades occur in upward, side- ways, downward, and angulated directions one after an- other from one highlight of the painting to another, and so forth.",
          "Fixation on Moving Objects—“Pursuit Movement.” The eyes can also remain fixed on a moving object, which is called pursuit movement. A highly developed cortical mechanism automatically detects the course of move- ment of an object and then rapidly develops a similar course of movement for the eyes. For example, if an ob- ject is moving up and down in a wavelike form at a rate of several times per second, the eyes at first may be unable to fixate on it. However, after a second or so, the eyes begin to jump by means of saccades in approximately the same wavelike pattern of movement as that of the object. Then, after another few seconds, the eyes develop progressively smoother movements and finally follow the wave move- ment almost exactly. This represents a high degree of au- tomatic subconscious computational ability by the pursuit system for controlling eye movements.",
          "Superior Colliculi Are Mainly Responsible for Turn- ing the Eyes and Head Toward a Visual Disturbance. Even after the visual cortex has been destroyed, a sudden visual disturbance in a lateral area of the visual field often causes immediate turning of the eyes in that direction. This turning does not occur if the superior colliculi have also been destroyed. To support this function, the various points of the retina are represented topographically in the superior colliculi in the same way as in the primary visual cortex, although with less accuracy. Even so, the principal direction of a flash of light in a peripheral retinal field is mapped by the colliculi, and secondary signals are trans- mitted to the oculomotor nuclei to turn the eyes. To help in this directional movement of the eyes, the superior colliculi also have topological maps of somatic sensations from the body and acoustic signals from the ears.",
          "The optic nerve fibers from the eyes to the colliculi, which are responsible for these rapid turning movements, are branches from the rapidly conducting M fibers, with one branch going to the visual cortex and the other going to the superior colliculi. In addition to causing the eyes to turn toward a visual disturbance, signals are relayed from the superior colliculi through the medial longitudinal fas- ciculus to other levels of the brain stem to cause turning of the whole head and even of the whole body toward the direction of the disturbance. Other types of nonvi- sual disturbances, such as strong sounds or even stroking of the side of the body, cause similar turning of the eyes, head, and body, but only if the superior colliculi are intact. Therefore, the superior colliculi play a global role in ori- enting the eyes, head, and body with respect to external disturbances, whether they are visual, auditory, or somatic."

The visual cortex plays an important role in fusion. We previ- ously discussed that corresponding points of the two reti- nas transmit visual signals to different neuronal layers of the lateral geniculate body, and these signals, in turn, are relayed to parallel neurons in the visual cortex. Interactions occur between these cortical neurons to cause interference excitation in specific neurons when the two visual images are not “in register”—that is, are not precisely “fused” This excitation presumably provides the signal that is transmit- ted to the oculomotor apparatus to cause convergence or divergence or rotation of the eyes so that fusion can be re-established. Once the corresponding points of the two retinas are in register, excitation of the specific “interfer- ence” neurons in the visual cortex disappears."

That is, the right eye sees a little more of the right-hand side of the object, and the left eye sees a little more of the left- hand side; the closer the object, the greater the disparity. Therefore, even when the two eyes are fused with each other, it is still impossible for all corresponding points in the two visual images to be exactly in register at the same time. Furthermore, the nearer the object is to the eyes, the less the degree of register. This degree of nonregister pro- vides the neural mechanism for stereopsis, an important mechanism for judging the distances of visual objects up to about 200 feet (61 meters).",
          "The neuronal cellular mechanism for stereopsis is based on the fact that some of the fiber pathways from the retinas to the visual cortex stray 1 to 2 degrees on each side of the central pathway. Therefore, some optic path- ways from the two eyes are exactly in register for objects 2 meters away; still another set of pathways is in register for objects 25 meters away. Thus, the distance is determined by which set or sets of pathways are excited by nonregis- ter or register. This phenomenon is called depth percep- tion, another name for stereopsis."

Soon the patterns of conjugate movements of the eyes become abnormally “set” in the neuronal control pathways themselves, so the eyes never fuse.",

In other patients, one eye alone is used all the time, and the other eye becomes re- pressed and is never used for precise vision. The visual acu- ity of the repressed eye develops only slightly, sometimes remaining as 20/400 or less. If the dominant eye then be- comes blinded, vision in the repressed eye can develop only to a slight extent in adults but far more in young children. This demonstrates that visual acuity is highly dependent on proper development of central nervous system synaptic connections from the eyes. In fact, even anatomically, the numbers of neuronal connections diminish in the visual cortex areas that would normally receive signals from the repressed eye."

When the eyes have been focused on some far object and must then suddenly focus on a near object, the lens usually accommodates for best acuity of vision within less than 1 second. Although the precise control mecha- nism that causes this rapid and accurate focusing of the eye is not fully understood, the following features are known.",
          "First, when the eyes suddenly change distance of the fixation point, the lens changes its strength in the proper direction to achieve a new state of focus within a fraction of a second. Second, different types of clues help change the lens strength in the proper direction, as follows: m 1. Chromatic aberration appears to be important. That is, red light rays focus slightly posteriorly to blue light rays because the lens bends blue rays more than red rays. The eyes appear to be able to detect which of these two types of rays is in better focus, and this clue relays information to the accommoda- tion mechanism with regard to whether to make the lens stronger or weaker. m 2. When the eyes fixate on a near object, the eyes must converge. The neural mechanisms for convergence cause a simultaneous signal to strengthen the lens of the eye. m 3. Because the fovea lies in a hollowed-out depression that is slightly deeper than the remainder of the ret- ina, the clarity of focus in the depth of the fovea is different from the clarity of focus on the edges. This difference may also give clues about which way the strength of the lens needs to be changed. m 4. The degree of accommodation of the lens oscillates slightly all the time at a frequency up to twice per second. The visual image becomes clearer when the oscillation of the lens strength is changing in the ap- propriate direction and becomes poorer when the lens strength is changing in the wrong direction. This could give a rapid clue as to which way the strength of the lens needs to change to provide appropriate focus.",

Instead, the system ac- tually reduces the distance but increases the force of move- ment about 1.3 times. In addition, the surface area of the tympanic membrane is about 55 square millimeters, where- as the surface area of the stapes averages 3.2 square millim- eters. This 17-fold difference times the 1.3-fold ratio of the lever system causes about 22 times as much total force to be exerted on the fluid of the cochlea as is exerted by the sound waves against the tympanic membrane. Because fluid has far greater inertia than air does, increased amounts of force are necessary to cause vibration in the fluid. Therefore, the tympanic membrane and ossicular system provide imped- ance matching between the sound waves in air and the sound vibrations in the fluid of the cochlea. The impedance matching is about 50% to 75% of perfect for sound frequencies between 300 and 3000 cycles/sec, which allows utiliza- tion of most of the energy in the incoming sound waves.",
          "In the absence of the ossicular system and tympanic membrane, sound waves can still travel directly through the air of the middle ear and enter the cochlea at the oval window. However, the sensitivity for hearing is then 15 to 20 decibels less than for ossicular transmission—equivalent to a decrease from a medium to a barely perceptible voice level.",
          "Attenuation of Sound by Contraction of the Tensor Tympani and Stapedius Muscles. When loud sounds are transmitted through the ossicular system and from there into the central nervous system, a reflex occurs af- ter a latent period of only 40 to 80 milliseconds to cause contraction of the stapedius muscle and, to a lesser extent, the tensor tympani muscle. The tensor tympani muscle pulls the handle of the malleus inward while the stape- dius muscle pulls the stapes outward. These two forces oppose each other and thereby cause the entire ossicular system to develop increased rigidity, thus greatly reducing the ossicular conduction of low-frequency sound, mainly frequencies below 1000 cycles/sec.",
          "This attenuation reflex can reduce the intensity of lower frequency sound transmission by 30 to 40 decibels, which is about the same difference as that between a loud voice and a whisper. The function of this mechanism is believed to be twofold—to protect the cochlea from dam- aging vibrations caused by excessively loud sound and to mask low-frequency sounds in loud environments. Mask- ing usually removes a major share of the background noise and allows a person to concentrate on sounds above 1000 cycles/sec, where most of the pertinent information in voice communication is transmitted.",
          "Another function of the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles is to decrease a person’s hearing sensitivity to his or her own speech. This effect is activated by collateral nerve signals transmitted to these muscles at the same time that the brain activates the voice mechanism."

Therefore, under appropriate conditions, a tuning fork or an electronic vibrator placed on any bony protuber- ance of the skull, but especially on the mastoid process near the ear, causes the person to hear the sound. However, the energy available even in loud sound in the air is not sufficient to cause hearing via bone conduction unless a special electro- mechanical sound-amplifying device is applied to the bone."

          "FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE COCHLEA m The cochlea is a system of coiled tubes, shown in Figure 53-1 and in cross section in Figure 53-2. It con- sists of three tubes coiled side by side: (1) the scala ves- tibuli; (2) the scala media; and (3) the scala tympani. The scala vestibuli and scala media are separated from each other by Reissner’s membrane (also called the vestibular membrane), shown in Figure 53-2B; the scala tympani and scala media are separated from each other by the basilar membrane. On the surface of the basilar mem- brane lies the organ of Corti, which contains a series of electromechanically sensitive cells, the hair cells. They are the receptive end organs that generate nerve impulses in response to sound vibrations.",
          "Figure 53-3 diagrams the functional parts of the uncoiled cochlea for conduction of sound vibrations. First, note that Reissner’s membrane is missing from this figure. This membrane is so thin and so easily moved that it does not obstruct the passage of sound vibrations from the scala vestibuli into the scala media. Therefore, as far as fluid conduction of sound is concerned, the scala vestibuli and scala media are considered to be a single chamber. As discussed later, Reissner’s membrane maintains a special kind of fluid in the scala media that is required for normal function of the sound-receptive hair cells.",
          "Sound vibrations enter the scala vestibuli from the faceplate of the stapes at the oval window. The faceplate covers this window and is connected with the window’s edges by a loose annular ligament so that it can move inward and outward with the sound vibrations. Inward movement causes the fluid to move forward in the scala vestibuli and scala media, and outward movement causes the fluid to move backward.",
          "Basilar Membrane and Resonance in the Cochlea. The basilar membrane is a fibrous membrane that sepa- rates the scala media from the scala tympani. It contains 20,000 to 30,000 basilar fibers that project from the bony center of the cochlea, the modiolus, toward the outer wall. These fibers are stiff, elastic, reedlike structures that are fixed at their basal ends in the central bony structure of the cochlea (the modiolus) but are not fixed at their distal ends, except that the distal ends are embedded in the loose basilar membrane. Because the fibers are stiff and free at one end, they can vibrate like the reeds of a harmonica.",
          "The lengths of the basilar fibers increase progressively, beginning at the oval window and going from the base of the cochlea to the apex, increasing from a length of about 0.04 millimeter near the oval and round windows to 0.5 millimeter at the tip of the cochlea (the “helicotrema’), a 12-fold increase in length.",
          "The diameters of the fibers, however, decrease from the oval window to the helicotrema, so their overall stiff- ness decreases more than 100-fold. As a result, the stiff, short fibers near the oval window of the cochlea vibrate best at a very high frequency, whereas the long, limber fibers near the tip of the cochlea vibrate best at a low frequency.",
          "Thus, high-frequency resonance of the basilar mem- brane occurs near the base, where the sound waves enter the cochlea through the oval window. However, low-frequency resonance occurs near the helicotrema, mainly because of the less stiff fibers but also because of increased “loading” with extra masses of fluid that must vibrate along the cochlear tubules."

          "When the foot of the stapes moves inward against the oval window, the round window must bulge outward because the cochlea is bounded on all sides by bony walls. The ini- tial effect of a sound wave entering at the oval window is to cause the basilar membrane at the base of the cochlea to bend in the direction of the round window. However, the elastic tension that is built up in the basilar fibers as they bend toward the round window initiates a fluid wave that “travels” along the basilar membrane toward the helico- trema. Figure 53-4A shows movement of a high-frequency wave down the basilar membrane, Figure 53-4B shows a medium-frequency wave, and Figure 53-4C shows a very low-frequency wave. Movement of the wave along the basi- lar membrane is comparable to the movement of a pressure wave along the arterial walls, discussed in Chapter 15; it is also comparable to a wave that travels along the surface of a pond.",
          "Vibration Patterns of the Basilar Membrane for Different Sound Frequencies. Note in Figure 53-4 the different patterns of transmission for sound waves of dif- ferent frequencies. Each wave is relatively weak at the outset but becomes strong when it reaches the portion of the basilar membrane that has a natural resonant fre- quency equal to the respective sound frequency. At this point, the basilar membrane can vibrate back and forth with such ease that the energy in the wave is dissipated. Consequently, the wave dies at this point and fails to travel the remaining distance along the basilar membrane. Thus, a high-frequency sound wave travels only a short distance along the basilar membrane before it reaches its resonant point and dies, a medium-frequency sound wave travels about halfway and then dies, and a very low- frequency sound wave travels the entire distance along the membrane.",
          "Another feature of the traveling wave is that it travels fast along the initial portion of the basilar membrane but becomes progressively slower as it goes farther into the cochlea. The cause of this difference is the high coefficient of elasticity of the basilar fibers near the oval window anda progressively decreasing coefficient farther along the mem- brane. This rapid initial transmission of the wave allows the high-frequency sounds to travel far enough into the cochlea to spread out and separate from one another on the basilar membrane. Without this rapid initial transmission, all the high-frequency waves would be bunched together within the first millimeter or so of the basilar membrane, and their frequencies could not be discriminated.",
          "Vibration Amplitude Pattern of the  Basilar Membrane. The dashed curves of Figure 53-54 show the position of a sound wave on the basilar membrane when the stapes is (a) all the way inward, (b) has moved back to the neutral point, (c) is all the way outward, and (d) has moved back again to the neutral point but is mov- ing inward. The shaded area around these different waves shows the extent of vibration of the basilar membrane during a complete vibratory cycle. This is the amplitude pattern of vibration of the basilar membrane for this par- ticular sound frequency.",
          "Figure 53-5B shows the amplitude patterns of vibra- tion for different frequencies, demonstrating that the maximum amplitude for sound at 8000 cycles/sec occurs near the base of the cochlea, whereas that for frequencies less than 200 cycles/sec is all the way at the tip of the basi- lar membrane near the helicotrema, the minute opening whereby the scala tympani and scala vestibuli communi- cate (Figure 53-2).",
          "The principal method whereby sound frequencies are discriminated from one another is based on the “place” of maximum stimulation of the nerve fibers from the organ of Corti lying on the basilar membrane, as explained in the next section."

Note that the organ of Corti lies on the surface of the basilar fibers and basilar membrane. The actual sensory recep- tors in the organ of Corti are two specialized types of nerve cells called hair cells—a single row of internal (or “inner”) hair cells, numbering about 3500 and measuring about 12 micrometers in diameter, and three or four rows of external (or “outer”) hair cells, numbering about 12,000 and having diameters of only about 8 micrometers. The bases and sides of the hair cells synapse with a network of cochlear nerve endings. Between 90% and 95% of these endings terminate on the inner hair cells, emphasizing their special importance for detection of sound.",
          "The nerve fibers stimulated by the hair cells lead to the spiral ganglion of Corti, which lies in the modiolus (cen- ter) of the cochlea. The spiral ganglion neuronal cells send axons—a total of about 30,000—into the cochlear nerve and then into the central nervous system at the level of the upper medulla. The relation of the organ of Corti to the spiral ganglion and to the cochlear nerve is shown in Figure 53-2.",
          "Excitation of the Hair Cells. Note in Figure 53-6 that minute hairs, or stereocilia, project upward from the hair cells and either touch or are embedded in the surface gel coating of the tectorial membrane, which lies above the stereocilia in the scala media. These hair cells are similar to the hair cells found in the macula and cristae ampul- laris of the vestibular apparatus, discussed in Chapter 56. Bending of the hairs in one direction depolarizes the hair cells, and bending in the opposite direction hyperpolar- izes them. This in turn excites the auditory nerve fibers synapsing with their bases.",
          "Figure 53-7A shows the mechanism whereby vibra- tion of the basilar membrane excites the hair endings. The outer ends of the hair cells are fixed tightly in a rigid struc- ture composed of a flat plate, called the reticular lamina, supported by triangular rods of Corti, which are attached tightly to the basilar fibers. The basilar fibers, the rods of Corti, and the reticular lamina move as a rigid unit.",
          "Upward movement of the basilar fiber rocks the retic- ular lamina upward and inward toward the modiolus. Then, when the basilar membrane moves downward, the reticular lamina rocks downward and outward. The inward and outward motion causes the hairs on the hair cells to shear back and forth against the tectorial mem- brane. Thus, the hair cells are excited whenever the basilar membrane vibrates.",
          "Auditory Signals Are Transmitted Mainly by the Inner Hair Cells. Even though there are three to four times as many outer hair cells as inner hair cells, about 90% of the auditory nerve fibers are stimulated by the inner cells rather than by the outer cells. Nonetheless, if the outer cells are damaged while the inner cells remain fully func- tional, a large amount of hearing loss occurs. Therefore, it has been proposed that the outer hair cells in some way control the sensitivity of the inner hair cells at different sound pitches, a phenomenon called “tuning” of the re- ceptor system. In support of this concept, a large number of retrograde nerve fibers pass from the brain stem to the vicinity of the outer hair cells. Stimulating these nerve fib- ers can actually cause shortening of the outer hair cells and possibly also change their degree of stiffness. These effects suggest a retrograde nervous mechanism for con- trol of the ear’s sensitivity to different sound pitches, acti- vated through the outer hair cells.",
          "Figure 53-7. A, Stimulation of the hair cells by to and fro movement of the hairs projecting into the gel coating of the tectorial membrane. B, Transduction of mechanical energy into neural signals by the hair cells. When the stereocilia are bent in the direction of the longer ones, K+ channels are opened, causing depolarization, which in turn opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The influx of Ca2+ augments the depolarization and elicits release of the excitatory transmitter gluta- mate, which depolarizes the sensory nerve.",
          "Hair Cell Receptor Potentials and Excitation of Audi- tory Nerve Fibers. The stereocilia (ie., the “hairs” pro- truding from the ends of the hair cells) are stiff structures because each has a rigid protein framework. Each hair cell has about 100 stereocilia on its apical border. These ste- reocilia become progressively longer on the side of the hair cell away from the modiolus. The tops of the shorter ste- reocilia are attached by thin filaments to the back sides of their adjacent longer stereocilia. Therefore, whenever the cilia are bent in the direction of the longer ones, the tips of the smaller stereocilia are tugged outward from the surface of the hair cell. This causes a mechanical transduction that opens 200 to 300 cation-conducting channels, allowing for the rapid movement of positively charged potassium ions from the surrounding scala media fluid into the stereocilia, which causes depolarization of the hair cell membrane (see Figure 53-7B). The depolarization opens voltage-sensitive calcium channels and causes influx of calcium ions, which augments the depolarization. Repolarization of the hair cell occurs mainly by exit of potassium ions through cal- cium ion-sensitive potassium channels.",
          "Thus, when the basilar fibers bend toward the scala vestibuli, the hair cells depolarize, and in the opposite direction they hyperpolarize, thereby generating an alter- nating hair cell receptor potential that, in turn, stimulates the cochlear nerve endings that synapse with the bases of the hair cells. It is believed that the rapidly acting neu- rotransmitter glutamate is released by the hair cells at these synapses during depolarization.",
          "Endocochlear Potential. To explain even more fully the electrical potentials generated by the hair cells, we need to explain another electrical phenomenon called the endo- cochlear potential. The scala media is filled with a fluid called endolymph, in contradistinction to the perilymph present in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani communicate directly with the subarachnoid space around the brain, so the perilymph is almost identical to cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, the endolymph that fills the scala media is an entirely different fluid secreted by the stria vascularis, a highly vascular area on the outer wall of the scala media. Endolymph contains a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, which is exactly opposite to the contents of perilymph.",
          "An electrical potential of about +80 millivolts exists all the time between endolymph and perilymph, with posi- tivity inside the scala media and negativity outside. This is called the endocochlear potential, and it is generated by continual secretion of positive potassium ions into the sca- la media by the stria vascularis.",
          "The importance of the endocochlear potential is that the tops of the hair cells project through the reticular lamina and are bathed by the endolymph of the scala media, whereas per- ilymph bathes the lower bodies of the hair cells. Furthermore, the hair cells have a negative intracellular potential of -70 millivolts with respect to the perilymph but -150 millivolts with respect to the endolymph at their upper surfaces, where the hairs project through the reticular lamina and into the endolymph. It is believed that this high electrical potential at the tips of the stereocilia sensitizes the cell an extra amount, thereby increasing its ability to respond to the slightest sound."

          "From earlier discussions in this chapter, it is apparent that low-frequency sounds cause maximal activation of the basilar membrane near the apex of the cochlea, and high-frequency sounds activate the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea. Intermediate-frequency sounds activate the mem- brane at intermediate distances between the two extremes. Furthermore, there is spatial organization of the nerve fibers in the cochlear pathway, all the way from the cochlea to the cerebral cortex. Recording of signals in the auditory tracts of the brain stem and in the auditory receptive fields of the cere- bral cortex shows that specific brain neurons are activated by specific sound frequencies. Therefore, the major method used by the nervous system to detect different sound frequen- cies is to determine the positions along the basilar membrane that are stimulated the most, called the place principle for the determination of sound frequency.",
          "Referring again to Figure 53-5, one can see that the distal end of the basilar membrane at the helicotrema is stimulated by all sound frequencies below 200 cycles/sec. Therefore, it has been difficult to understand from the place principle how one can differentiate between low sound fre- quencies in the range of 200 down to 20 cycles/sec. These low frequencies have been postulated to be discriminated mainly by the so-called volley or frequency principle. That is, low-frequency sounds, from 20 to 1500 to 2000 cycles/ sec, can cause volleys of nerve impulses synchronized at the same frequencies, and these volleys are transmitted by the cochlear nerve into the cochlear nuclei of the brain. It is further suggested that the cochlear nuclei can distinguish the different frequencies of the volleys. In fact, destruction of the entire apical half of the cochlea, which destroys the basilar membrane where all lower frequency sounds are normally detected, does not totally eliminate discrimina- tion of the lower frequency sounds."

          "Second, as the amplitude of vibration increases, it causes more and more of the hair cells on the fringes of the resonating portion of the basilar membrane to become stimulated, thus causing spatial summation of impulses— that is, transmission through many nerve fibers rather than through only a few.",
          "Third, the outer hair cells do not become stimulated significantly until vibration of the basilar membrane reaches high intensity, and stimulation of these cells pre- sumably apprises the nervous system that the sound is loud.",
          "Detection of Changes in Loudness—The Power Law. As pointed out in Chapter 47, a person interprets changes in intensity of sensory stimuli approximately in propor- tion to an inverse power function of the actual intensity. In the case of sound, the interpreted sensation changes approximately in proportion to the cube root of the ac- tual sound intensity. To express this concept in another way, the ear can discriminate differences in sound inten- sity from the softest whisper to the loudest possible noise, representing an approximately 1 trillion times increase in sound energy or 1 million times increase in amplitude of movement of the basilar membrane. Yet, the ear inter- prets this much difference in sound level as approximately a 10,000-fold change. Thus, the scale of intensity is greatly “compressed” by the sound perception mechanisms of the auditory system, which allows a person to interpret dif- ferences in sound intensities over a far wider range than would be possible were it not for compression of the in- tensity scale.",
          "Decibel Unit. Because of the extreme changes in sound intensities that the ear can detect and discriminate, sound intensities are usually expressed in terms of the logarithm of their actual intensities. A 10-fold increase in sound en- ergy is called 1 bel, and 0.1 bel is called 1 decibel. One decibel represents an actual increase in sound energy of 1.26 times.",
          "Another reason for using the decibel system to express changes in loudness is that in the usual sound intensity range for communication, the ears can barely distinguish an approximately 1-decibel change in sound intensity.",
          "Threshold for Hearing Sound at _ Different Frequencies. Figure 53-8 shows the pressure thresholds at which sounds of different frequencies can barely be heard by the ear. This figure demonstrates that a 3,000 cy- cles/sec sound can be heard even when its intensity is as low as 70 decibels below 1 dyne/cm? sound pressure level, which is one ten-millionth microwatt per square centim- eter. Conversely, a 100 cycles/sec sound can be detected only if its intensity is 10,000 times as great as this.",
          "Frequency Range of Hearing. The frequencies of sound that a young person can hear are between 20 and 20,000 cycles/sec. However, referring again to Figure 53-8, we see that the sound range depends to a great extent on loudness. If the loudness is 60 decibels below 1 dyne/cm2 sound pressure level, the sound range is 500 to 5000 cy- cles/sec; only with intense sounds can the complete range of 20 to 20,000 cycles be achieved. In old age, this fre- quency range is usually shortened to 50 to 8,000 cycles/ sec or less, as discussed later in this chapter."

A few second-order fibers also pass to the superior olivary nucleus on the same side.",

From there, the pathway passes to the medial geniculate nucleus, where all the fibers do synapse. Finally, the pathway proceeds via auditory radiation to the auditory cortex, located mainly in the superior gyrus of the temporal lobe.",
          "Several important points should be noted. First, signals from both ears are transmitted through the pathways of both sides of the brain, with a preponderance of transmis- sion in the contralateral pathway. In at least three places in the brain stem, crossing over occurs between the two pathways: (1) in the trapezoid body; (2) in the commissure between the two nuclei of the lateral lemnisci; and (3) in the commissure connecting the two inferior colliculi.",

Other collaterals go to the vermis of the cerebel- lum, which is also activated instantaneously in the event of a sudden noise.",
          "Third, a high degree of spatial orientation is maintained in the fiber tracts from the cochlea all the way to the cor- tex. In fact, there are three spatial patterns for termination of the different sound frequencies in the cochlear nuclei, two patterns in the inferior colliculi, one precise pattern for discrete sound frequencies in the auditory cortex, and at least five other less precise patterns in the auditory cor- tex and auditory association areas.",

Single nerve fibers entering the cochlear nuclei from the auditory nerve can fire at rates up to at least 1000/ sec, with the rate being determined mainly by the loud- ness of the sound. At sound frequencies up to 2000 to 4000 cycles/sec, the auditory nerve impulses are often synchro- nized with the sound waves, but they do not necessarily occur with every wave.",
          "In the auditory tracts of the brain stem, the firing is usually no longer synchronized with the sound frequency, except at sound frequencies below 200 cycles/sec. Above the level of the inferior colliculi, even this synchronization is mainly lost. These findings demonstrate that the sound signals are not transmitted unchanged directly from the ear to the higher levels of the brain; instead, information from the sound signals begins to be dissected from the impulse traffic at levels as low as the cochlear nuclei. We will have more to say about this subject later, especially in relation to perception of direction from which sound comes."

In each of these maps, high-frequency sounds excite neurons at one end of the map, whereas low-frequency sounds excite neurons at the opposite end. In most maps, the low-frequency sounds are located ante- riorly, as shown in Figure 53-10, and the high-frequency sounds are located posteriorly. This setup is not true for all the maps.",
          "Why does the auditory cortex have so many different tonotopic maps? The answer, presumably, is that each of the separate areas dissects out some specific feature of the sounds. For example, one of the large maps in the pri- mary auditory cortex almost certainly discriminates the sound frequencies and gives the person the psychic sen- sation of sound pitches. Another map is probably used to detect the direction from which the sound comes. Other auditory cortex areas detect special qualities, such as the sudden onset of sounds, or perhaps special modulations, such as noise versus pure frequency sounds.",
          "The frequency range to which each individual neuron in the auditory cortex responds is much narrower than that in the cochlear and brain stem relay nuclei. Referring to Figure 53-5B, note that the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea is stimulated by sounds of all frequen- cies and, in the cochlear nuclei, this same breadth of sound representation is found. Yet, by the time the excitation has reached the cerebral cortex, most sound-responsive neurons respond only to a narrow range of frequencies rather than to a broad range. Therefore, somewhere along the pathway, processing mechanisms “sharpen” the fre- quency response. This sharpening effect is believed to be caused mainly by lateral inhibition, discussed in Chapter 47 in relation to mechanisms for transmitting informa- tion in nerves. That is, stimulation of the cochlea at one frequency inhibits sound frequencies on both sides of this primary frequency; this inhibition is caused by collateral fibers angling off the primary signal pathway and exert- ing inhibitory influences on adjacent pathways. This same effect is important in sharpening patterns of somesthetic images, visual images, and other types of sensations.",
          "Many of the neurons in the auditory cortex, especially in the auditory association cortex, do not respond only to specific sound frequencies in the ear. It is believed that these neurons “associate” different sound frequen- cies with one another or associate sound information with information from other sensory areas of the cortex. Indeed, the parietal portion of the auditory association cortex partly overlaps somatosensory area II, which could provide an opportunity for the association of auditory information with somatosensory information.",

Complete bilateral removal of the auditory cortex does not prevent a cat or monkey from detecting sounds or reacting in a crude manner to sounds. However, it does greatly reduce or sometimes even abolish the animal’s ability to discriminate different sound pitches and espe- cially patterns of sound. For example, an animal that has been trained to recognize a combination or sequence of tones, one following the other in a particular pattern, los- es this ability when the auditory cortex is destroyed; fur- thermore, the animal cannot relearn this type of response. Therefore, the auditory cortex is especially important in the discrimination of tonal and sequential sound patterns.",
          "Destruction of both primary auditory cortices in the human being greatly reduces one’s sensitivity for hear- ing. Destruction of one side only slightly reduces hearing in the opposite ear; it does not cause deafness in the ear because of many crossover connections from side to side in the auditory neural pathway. However, it does affect one’s ability to localize the source of a sound because comparative signals in both cortices are required for sound localization.",
          "Lesions that affect the auditory association areas but not the primary auditory cortex do not decrease a per- son's ability to hear and differentiate sound tones or even to interpret at least simple patterns of sound. However, the person is often unable to interpret the meaning of the sound heard. For example, lesions in the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, which is called Wernicke’s area and is part of the auditory association cortex, often make it impossible for a person to interpret the meanings of words even though he or she hears them perfectly well and can even repeat them. These functions of the auditory association areas and their relation to the overall intellec- tual functions of the brain are discussed in Chapter 58."

          "A person determines the horizontal direction from which sound comes by two principal means: (1) the time lag between the entry of sound into one ear and its entry into the opposite ear; and (2) the difference between the inten- sities of the sounds in the two ears.",
          "The first mechanism functions best at frequencies below 3000 cycles/sec, and the second mechanism oper- ates best at higher frequencies because the head is a greater sound barrier at these frequencies. The time lag mechanism discriminates direction much more exactly than the intensity mechanism because it does not depend on extraneous factors but only on the exact interval of time between two acoustical signals. If a person is look- ing straight toward the source of the sound, the sound reaches both ears at exactly the same instant, whereas if the right ear is closer to the sound than the left ear is, the sound signals from the right ear enter the brain ahead of those from the left ear.",
          "These two mechanisms cannot tell whether the sound is emanating from in front of or behind the person or from above or below. This discrimination is achieved mainly by the pinnae (the visible outer part), which act as funnels to direct the sound into the two ears. The shape of the pinna changes the quality of the sound entering the ear, depending on the direction from which the sound comes. It changes the quality by emphasizing specific sound fre- quencies from the different directions.",
          "Neural Mechanisms for Detecting Sound Direction. Destruction of the auditory cortex on both sides of the brain causes loss of almost all ability to detect the direction from which sound comes. Yet, the neural analyses for this detec- tion process begin in the superior olivary nuclei in the brain stem, even though the neural pathways all the way from these nuclei to the cortex are required for interpretation of the signals. The mechanism is believed to be the following.",
          "The superior olivary nucleus is divided into two sec- tions: (1) the medial superior olivary nucleus; and (2) the lateral superior olivary nucleus. The lateral nucleus is con- cerned with detecting the direction from which the sound is coming, presumably by simply comparing the difference in intensities of the sound reaching the two ears and send- ing an appropriate signal to the auditory cortex to esti- mate the direction.",
          "The medial superior olivary nucleus, however, has a specific mechanism for detecting the time lag between acoustical signals entering the two ears. This nucleus con- tains large numbers of neurons that have two major den- drites, one projecting to the right and the other to the left. The acoustical signal from the right ear impinges on the right dendrite, and the signal from the left ear impinges on the left dendrite. The intensity of excitation of each neuron is highly sensitive to a specific time lag between the two acoustical signals from the two ears. The neurons near one border of the nucleus respond maximally to a short time lag, whereas those near the opposite border respond to a long time lag; those in between respond to intermediate time lags.",
          "Thus, a spatial pattern of neuronal stimulation develops in the medial superior olivary nucleus, with sound from directly in front of the head stimulating one set of olivary neurons maximally and sounds from different side angles stimulating other sets of neurons on opposite sides. This spatial orientation of signals is then transmitted to the auditory cortex, where sound direction is determined by the locus of the maximally stimulated neurons. All these signals for determining sound direction are believed to be transmitted through a different pathway and excite a different locus in the cerebral cortex from the transmis- sion pathway and termination locus for tonal patterns of sound.",
          "This mechanism for detection of sound direction indi- cates again how specific information in sensory signals is dissected out as the signals pass through different levels of neuronal activity. In this case, the “quality” of sound direc- tion is separated from the “quality” of sound tones at the level of the superior olivary nuclei."

Indeed, direct stimulation of discrete points in the olivary nucleus has been shown to inhibit specific areas of the organ of Corti, reducing their sound sensitivities by 15 to 20 decibels. One can readily understand how this mechanism could allow someone to direct their attention to sounds of particular qualities while rejecting sounds of other qualities.

          "If either the cochlea or the auditory nerve is destroyed, the person becomes permanently deaf. However, if the cochlea and nerve are still intact but the tympanum- ossicular system has been destroyed or ankylosed (“frozen” in place by fibrosis or calcification), sound waves can still be conducted into the cochlea by means of bone conduction from a sound generator applied to the skull over the ear.",
          "Audiometer. To determine the nature of hearing dis- abilities, an audiometer is used. This instrument is an earphone connected to an electronic oscillator capable of emitting pure tones ranging from low frequencies to high frequencies, and it is calibrated so that zero-intensity-level sound at each frequency is the loudness that can barely be heard by the normal ear. A calibrated volume control can increase the loudness above the zero level. If the loudness must be increased to 30 decibels above normal before it can be heard, the person is said to have a hearing loss of 30 decibels at that particular frequency.",
          "In performing a hearing test using an audiometer, one tests about 8 to 10 frequencies covering the auditory spec- trum, and the hearing loss is determined for each of these frequencies. Then the so-called audiogram is plotted, as shown in Figure 53-11 and 53-12, depicting hearing loss at each of the frequencies in the auditory spectrum. The au- diometer, in addition to being equipped with an earphone for testing air conduction by the ear, is equipped with a mechanical vibrator for testing bone conduction from the mastoid process of the skull into the cochlea.",
          "Audiogram in Nerve Deafness. In nerve deafness, which includes damage to the cochlea, the auditory nerve, or the central nervous system circuits from the ear, the per- son has loss of ability to hear sound as tested by both air conduction and bone conduction. An audiogram depict- ing partial nerve deafness is shown in Figure 53-11. In this figure, the deafness is mainly for high-frequency sound. Such deafness could be caused by damage to the base of the cochlea. This type of deafness occurs to some extent in almost all older people.",
          "Other patterns of nerve deafness frequently occur as follows: (1) deafness for low-frequency sounds caused by excessive and prolonged exposure to very loud sounds (e.g., a rock band or a jet airplane engine) because low-frequency sounds are usually louder and more damaging to the organ of Corti; and (2) deafness for all frequencies caused by drug sensitivity of the organ of Corti—in particular, sensitivity to some antibiotics such as streptomycin, gentamicin, kana- mycin, and chloramphenicol.",
          "Audiogram for Middle Ear Conduction Deafness. A common type of deafness is caused by fibrosis in the mid- dle ear after repeated infection or by fibrosis that occurs in the hereditary disease called otosclerosis. In either case, the sound waves cannot be transmitted easily through the ossi- cles from the tympanic membrane to the oval window. Fig- ure 53-12 shows an audiogram from a person with “middle ear air conduction deafness.” In this case, bone conduction is essentially normal, but conduction through the ossicular system is greatly depressed at all frequencies, but more so at low frequencies. In some cases of conduction deafness, the faceplate of the stapes becomes “ankylosed” by bone overgrowth to the edges of the oval window. Here, the per- son becomes totally deaf for ossicular conduction but can regain almost normal hearing by the surgical removal of the stapes and its replacement with a minute Teflon or metal prosthesis that transmits the sound from the incus to the oval window."

          "A person can perceive hundreds of different tastes. They are all thought to be combinations of the elemen- tary taste sensations, just as all the colors we can see are combinations of the three primary colors, as described in Chapter 51.",
          "Sour Taste. The sour taste is caused by acids—that is, by the hydrogen ion concentration—and the intensity of this taste sensation is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration (i.e., the more acidic the food, the stronger the sour sensation be- comes).",
          "Salty Taste. The salty taste is elicited by ionized salts, mainly by the sodium ion concentration. The quality of the taste varies somewhat from one salt to another be- cause some salts elicit other taste sensations in addition to saltiness. The cations of the salts, especially sodium cations, are mainly responsible for the salty taste, but the anions also contribute to a lesser extent.",
          "Sweet Taste. The sweet taste is not caused by any single class of chemicals. Some of the types of chemicals that cause this taste include sugars, glycols, alcohols, alde- hydes, ketones, amides, esters, some amino acids, some small proteins, sulfonic acids, halogenated acids, and in- organic salts of lead and beryllium. Note specifically that most of the substances that cause a sweet taste are organic chemicals. It is especially interesting that slight changes in the chemical structure, such as the addition of a simple radical, can often change the substance from sweet to bit- ter.",
          "Bitter Taste. The bitter taste, like the sweet taste, is not caused by any single type of chemical agent. Here again, the substances that give the bitter taste are almost entirely organic substances. Two particular classes of substances are especially likely to cause bitter taste sensations: (1) long-chain organic substances that contain nitrogen; and (2) alkaloids. The alkaloids include many of the drugs used in medicines, such as quinine, caffeine, strychnine, and nicotine.",
          "Some substances that initially taste sweet have a bitter aftertaste. This characteristic is true of saccharin, which makes this substance objectionable to some people. High concentrations of salts may also result in a bitter taste.",
          "The bitter taste, when it occurs in high intensity, usu- ally causes the person or animal to reject the food. This reaction is undoubtedly an important function of the bit- ter taste sensation because many deadly toxins found in poisonous plants are alkaloids, and virtually all these alka- loids cause an intensely bitter taste, usually followed by rejection of the food.",
          "Umami Taste. Limami, a Japanese word meaning “deli- cious,’ designates a pleasant taste sensation that is qualita- tively different from sour, salty, sweet, or bitter. Umami is the dominant taste of food containing z-glutamate, such as meat extracts and aging cheese.

The taste bud is composed of epithe- lial cells; some are supporting cells called sustentacular cells and others are called taste cells. There are about 100 taste cells in each taste bud. The taste cells are continually being replaced by mitotic division of surrounding epithe- lial cells, so some taste cells are young cells. Others are mature cells that lie toward the center of the bud; these cells soon break up and dissolve. The average life span of each taste cell is estimated to be about 10 days, although there is considerable variation, with some taste cells being eliminated in only 2 days while others may survive for over 3 weeks.",
          "The outer tips of the taste cells are arranged around a minute taste pore, shown in Figure 54-1B. From the tip of each taste cell, several microvilli, or taste hairs, protrude outward into the taste pore to approach the cavity of the mouth. These microvilli provide the receptor surface for taste.",
          "Interwoven around the bodies of the taste cells is a branching terminal network of taste nerve fibers that are stimulated by the taste receptor cells. Some of these fibers invaginate into folds of the taste cell membranes. Many vesicles form beneath the cell membrane near the fibers. These vesicles are believed to contain a neurotransmit- ter substance that is released through the cell membrane to excite the nerve fiber endings in response to taste stimulation.",
          "Location of the Taste Buds. The taste buds are found on three types of papillae of the tongue, as follows (see Figure 54-1A): (1) a large number of taste buds are on the walls of the troughs that surround the circumvallate papillae, which form a V line on the surface of the pos- terior tongue; (2) moderate numbers are on the foliate papillae located in the folds along the lateral surfaces of the tongue; and (3) moderate numbers of taste buds are on the fungiform papillae over the flat anterior sur- face of the tongue. Additional taste buds are located on the palate, and a few are found on the tonsillar pillars, on the epiglottis, and even in the proximal esophagus. Adults have 3000 to 10,000 taste buds, and children have a few more. Beyond the age of 45 years, many taste buds degenerate, causing taste sensitivity to decrease in old age.",
          "Specificity of Taste Buds for a Primary Taste Stimulus. Microelectrode studies from single taste buds show that each taste bud usually responds mostly to one of the five primary taste stimuli when the taste substance is in low concentration. However, at high concentration, most buds can be excited by two or more of the primary taste stimu- li, as well as by a few other taste stimuli that do not fit into the “primary” categories."

          "Mechanism of Stimulation of Taste Buds Receptor Potential. The membrane of the taste cell, like that of most other sensory receptor cells, is negatively charged on the inside with respect to the outside. Appli- cation of a taste substance to the taste hairs causes par- tial loss of this negative potential—that is, the taste cell becomes depolarized. In most cases, the decrease in po- tential, within a wide range, is approximately proportional to the logarithm of concentration of the stimulating sub- stance. This change in electrical potential in the taste cell is called the receptor potential for taste.",
          "The mechanism whereby most stimulating substances react with the taste villi to initiate the receptor potential is by binding of the taste chemical to a protein receptor molecule that lies on the outer surface of the taste recep- tor cell, near to or protruding through a villus membrane. This action, in turn, opens ion channels, which allows positively charged sodium ions or hydrogen ions to enter and depolarize the normal negativity of the cell. Then, the taste chemical is gradually washed away from the taste villus by the saliva, which removes the stimulus.",
          "The type of receptor protein in each taste villus deter- mines the type of taste that will be perceived. For sodium ions and hydrogen ions, which elicit salty and sour taste sensations, respectively, the receptor proteins open spe- cific ion channels, likely the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), in the apical membranes of the taste cells, thereby activating the receptors. However, for the sweet and bit- ter taste sensations, the portions of the G-protein coupled receptors that protrude through the apical membranes activate second-messenger transmitter substances inside the taste cells; these second messengers cause intracellu- lar chemical changes that elicit the taste signals.",
          "Sweet-tasting compounds are detected by a combi- nation of two closely related G-protein-coupled taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3. The receptors responsible for umami taste is believed to be a complex of T1R1 and T1R3 proteins. Thus, T1R3 appears to function as a co- receptor for sweet and umami tastes.",
          "Bitter taste is sensed by another family (T2R) of approximately 30 different G-protein coupled receptors. Individual bitter-sensing taste receptor cells express mul- tiple T2Rs, each of which recognizes a unique set of bitter compounds. This pattern of receptor expression permits detection of a variety of bitter compounds through a sin- gle type of taste receptor cell.",
          "Sour taste, associated with acidic food or drink, is believed to be sensed by ion channels that are opened by hydrogen ions although the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that an acid- sensitive potassium channel (KIR2.1) and a hydrogen ion-selective ion channel (otopetrin 1) may mediate acid responses in taste receptor cells.",
          "Generation of Nerve Impulses by the Taste Bud. On first application of the taste stimulus, the rate of discharge of the nerve fibers from taste buds rises to a peak in a small fraction of a second but then adapts within the next few seconds back to a lower steady level as long as the taste stimulus remains. Thus, a strong immediate signal is transmitted by the taste nerve, and a weaker continuous signal is transmitted as long as the taste bud is exposed to the taste stimulus."

Taste impulses from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue pass first into the lingual nerve, then through the chorda tympani into the facial nerve, and finally into the tractus solitarius in the brain stem. Taste sensations from the circumvallate papillae on the back of the tongue and from other pos- terior regions of the mouth and throat are transmitted through the glossopharyngeal nerve also into the tractus solitarius, but at a slightly more posterior level. Finally, a few taste signals are transmitted into the tractus solitarius from the base of the tongue and other parts of the pharyn- geal region by way of the vagus nerve.",
          "All taste fibers synapse in the posterior brain stem in the nuclei of the tractus solitarius. These nuclei send second-order neurons to a small area of the ventral pos- terior medial nucleus of the thalamus, located slightly medial to the thalamic terminations of the facial regions of the dorsal column-medial lemniscal system. From the thalamus, third-order neurons are transmitted to the lower tip of the postcentral gyrus in the parietal cerebral ortex, where it curls deep into the sylvian fissure, and into he adjacent opercular insular area. This area lies slightly ateral, ventral, and rostral to the area for tongue tactile ignals in cerebral somatic area I. From this description of he taste pathways, it is evident that they closely parallel he somatosensory pathways from the tongue.",
          "Taste Reflexes Are Integrated in the Brain Stem. From the tractus solitarius, many taste signals are transmitted within the brain stem itself directly into the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei. These areas transmit signals to the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands to help control the secretion of saliva during the ingestion and digestion of food.",
          "Rapid Adaptation of Taste. Everyone is familiar with the fact that taste sensations adapt rapidly, often almost completely, within a minute or so of continuous stimula- tion. Yet, from electrophysiological studies of taste nerve fibers, it is clear that adaptation of the taste buds usually accounts for no more than about half of this rapid taste adaptation. Therefore, the final extreme degree of adapta- tion that occurs in the sensation of taste almost certainly occurs in the central nervous system, although the mech- anisms are not known. This mechanism of adaptation is different from that of many other sensory systems, which adapt mainly at the receptors."

Second, an animal given injections of excessive amounts of insulin develops a depleted blood sugar level, and the animal automatically chooses the sweetest food from among many samples. Third, calcium-depleted, parathyroidectomized animals automatically choose drinking water with a high concen- tration of calcium chloride.",

          "The phenomenon of taste preference almost certainly results from some mechanism located in the central nervous system and not from a mechanism in the taste receptors, although the receptors often become sensitized in favor of a needed nutrient. An important reason for believing that taste preference is mainly a central nervous system phenomenon is that previous experience with unpleasant or pleasant tastes plays a major role in deter- mining one’s taste preferences. For example, if a person becomes sick soon after eating a particular type of food, the person then generally develops a negative taste prefer- ence, or taste aversion, for that particular food; the same effect can be demonstrated in lower animals."

The odorant substance, on coming in contact with the olfactory mem- brane surface, first diffuses into the mucus that covers the cilia and then it binds with receptor proteins in the mem- brane of each cilium (Figure 54-4). Each receptor protein is actually a long molecule that threads its way through the membrane about seven times, folding inward and outward.",
          "The odorant binds with the portion of the receptor protein that folds to the outside. The inside of the folding protein is coupled to a G protein, itself a combination of three subu- nits. On excitation of the receptor protein, an alpha subu- nit breaks away from the G protein and activates adenylyl cyclase, which is attached to the inside of the ciliary mem- brane near the receptor cell body. The activated cyclase, in turn, converts many molecules of intracellular adeno- sine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic adenosine monophos- phate (cAMP). Finally, this cAMP activates another nearby membrane protein, a gated sodium ion channel, that opens its “gate” and allows large numbers of sodium ions to pour through the membrane into the receptor cell cytoplasm. The sodium ions increase the electrical potential in the positive direction inside the cell membrane, thus exciting the olfactory neuron and transmitting action potentials into the central nervous system via the olfactory nerve.",
          "Figure 54-4. Summary of olfactory signal transduction. Binding of the odorant to a G-protein-coupled receptor causes the activation of adenylate cyclase, which converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cy- clic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP). The cAMP activates a gated sodium channel that increases sodium influx and depolarizes the cell, exciting the olfactory neuron and transmitting action potentials to the central nervous system.",
          "The importance of this mechanism for activating olfac- tory nerves is that it greatly multiplies the excitatory effect of even the weakest odorant. To summarize: (1) activation of the receptor protein by the odorant substance activates the G-protein complex, which, in turn (2) activates mul- tiple molecules of adenylyl cyclase inside the olfactory cell membrane, which (3) causes the formation of many times more molecules of cAMP, and finally, (4) the cAMP opens still many times more sodium ion channels. Therefore, even a minute concentration of a specific odorant initiates a cascading effect that opens extremely large numbers of sodium channels. This process accounts for the exquisite sensitivity of the olfactory neurons to even the slightest amount of odorant.",
          "In addition to the basic chemical mechanism whereby the olfactory cells are stimulated, several physical factors affect the degree of stimulation. First, only volatile sub- stances that can be sniffed into the nasal cavity can be smelled. Second, the stimulating substance must be at least slightly water-soluble so that it can pass through the mucus to reach the olfactory cilia. Third, it is helpful for the substance to be at least slightly lipid-soluble, presum- ably because lipid constituents of the cilium are a weak barrier to non-lipid-soluble odorants.",
          "Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials in Olfactory Cells. The membrane potential inside unstim- ulated olfactory cells, as measured by microelectrodes, averages about —55 millivolts. At this potential, most of the cells generate continuous action potentials at a very slow rate, varying from once every 20 seconds up to two or three per second.",
          "Most odorants cause depolarization of the olfactory cell membrane, decreasing the negative potential in the cell from the normal level of -55 millivolts to -30 milli- volts or less. Along with this, the number of action poten- tials increases to 20 to 30 per second, which is a high rate for the minute olfactory nerve fibers.",
          "Over a wide range, the rate of olfactory nerve impulses changes approximately in proportion to the logarithm of the stimulus strength, which demonstrates that the olfac- tory receptors obey principles of transduction similar to those of other sensory receptors.",
          "Rapid Adaptation of Olfactory Sensations. The olfac- tory receptors adapt about 50% in the first second or so after stimulation. Thereafter, they adapt very little and very slowly. Yet, we all know from our own experience that smell sensations adapt almost to extinction within a minute or so after entering a strongly odorous atmos- phere. Because this psychological adaptation is far greater than the degree of adaptation of the receptors, it is almost certain that most of the additional adaptation occurs in the central nervous system, which seems to be true for the adaptation of taste sensations as well.",
          "The following neuronal mechanism for the adaptation is postulated: large numbers of centrifugal nerve fibers pass from the olfactory regions of the brain backward along the olfactory tract and terminate on special inhibi- tory cells in the olfactory bulb, the granule cells. After the onset of an olfactory stimulus, the central nervous system quickly develops strong feedback inhibition to suppress relay of the smell signals through the olfactory bulb."

          "In the past, most physiologists were convinced that the many smell sensations are subserved by a few rather dis- crete primary sensations in the same way that vision and taste are subserved by a few select primary sensations. On the basis of psychological studies, one attempt to classify these sensations is the following: m 1. Camphoraceous m 2. Musky m 3. Floral m 4. Pepperminty m 5. Ethereal m 6. Pungent m 7. Putrid",
          "It is certain that this list does not represent the true primary sensations of smell. Multiple clues, including specific studies of the genes that encode for the recep- tor proteins, suggest the existence of at least 100 primary sensations of smell—a marked contrast to only three pri- mary sensations of color detected by the eyes and only five primary sensations of taste detected by the tongue. Some studies suggest that there may be as many as 1000 different types of odorant receptors. Further support for the many primary sensations of smell is that people have been found who have odor blindness for single substances; such discrete odor blindness has been identified for more than 50 different substances. It is presumed that odor blindness for each substance represents lack of the appro- priate receptor protein in olfactory cells for that particular substance.",
          "Affective Nature of Smell. Smell, even more so than taste, has the affective quality of either pleasantness or unpleasantness, and thus smell is probably even more important than taste for the selection of food. A person who has previously eaten food that disagreed with him or her is often nauseated by the smell of that same food on a second occasion. Conversely, perfume of the right quality can be a powerful stimulant of human emotions. In addi- tion, in some animals, odors are the primary excitant of sexual drive.",
          "Threshold for Smell. One of the principal characteris- tics of smell is the minute quantity of stimulating agent in the air that can elicit a smell sensation. For example, the substance methylmercaptan can be smelled when only one 25 trillionth of a gram is present in each milliliter of air. Because of this very low threshold, this substance is mixed with natural gas to give the gas an odor that can be detected when even small amounts of gas leak from a pipeline.",
          "Gradations of Smell Intensities. Although the thresh- old concentrations of substances that evoke smell are extremely slight, for many (if not most) odorants, con- centrations only 10 to 50 times above the threshold evoke maximum intensity of smell. This range of intensity dis- crimination is in contrast to most other sensory systems of the body, in which the ranges of intensity discrimina- tion are tremendous—for example, 500,000 to 1 for the eyes and 1 trillion to 1 for the ears. This difference might be explained by the fact that smell is concerned more with detecting the presence or absence of odors rather than with quantitative detection of their intensities."

          "Transmission of Olfactory Signals Into the Olfactory Bulb. The olfactory bulb is shown in Figure 54-5. The ol- factory nerve fibers leading backward from the bulb are called cranial nerve I, or the olfactory tract. In reality, both the tract and the bulb are an anterior outgrowth of brain tissue from the base of the brain; the bulbous enlargement at its end, the olfactory bulb, lies over the cribriform plate, separating the brain cavity from the upper reaches of the nasal cavity. The cribriform plate has multiple small per- forations through which an equal number of small nerves pass upward from the olfactory membrane in the nasal cavity to enter the olfactory bulb in the cranial cavity. Figure 54-3 demonstrates the close relation between the olfactory cells in the olfactory membrane and the olfac- tory bulb, showing short axons from the olfactory cells terminating in multiple globular structures in the olfac- tory bulb called glomeruli. Each bulb has several thousand such glomeruli, each of which is the terminus for about 25,000 axons from olfactory cells. Each glomerulus also is the terminus for dendrites from about 25 large mitral cells and about 60 smaller tufted cells, the cell bodies of which lie in the olfactory bulb superior to the glomeruli. These dendrites receive synapses from the olfactory cell neurons; the mitral and tufted cells send axons through the olfactory tract to transmit olfactory signals to higher levels in the central nervous system.",
          "Some research has suggested that different glomeruli respond to different odors. It is possible that specific glomeruli are the real clue to the analysis of different odor signals transmitted into the central nervous system."

          "The olfactory tract enters the brain at the anterior junc- tion between the mesencephalon and cerebrum; there, the tract divides into two pathways, as shown in Figure 54-5, one passing medially into the medial olfactory area of the brain stem and the other passing laterally into the lateral olfactory area. The medial olfactory area represents a very primitive olfactory system, whereas the lateral olfactory area is the input to the following: (1) a less old olfactory system; and (2) a newer system.",
          "The Primitive Olfactory System—The Medial Olfactory Area. The medial olfactory area consists of a group of nu- clei located in the midbasal portions of the brain imme- diately anterior to the hypothalamus. Most conspicuous are the septal nuclei, which are midline nuclei that feed into the hypothalamus and other primitive portions of the brain’s limbic system. This is the brain area most con- cerned with basic behavior (as described in Chapter 59).",
          "The importance of this medial olfactory area is best understood by considering what happens in animals when the lateral olfactory areas on both sides of the brain are removed, and only the medial system remains. The removal of these areas hardly affects the more basic responses to olfaction, such as licking the lips, salivation, and other feeding responses caused by the smell of food or by basic emotional drives associated with smell. Con- versely, removal of the lateral areas abolishes the more complicated olfactory conditioned reflexes.",
          "The Less Old Olfactory System—The Lateral Olfactory Area. The lateral olfactory area is composed mainly of the prepyriform and pyriform cortex plus the cortical portion of the amygdaloid nuclei. From these areas, signal path- ways pass into almost all portions of the limbic system, especially into less primitive portions such as the hip- pocampus, which seem to be most important for learning to like or dislike certain foods depending on one’s experi- ences with them. For example, it is believed that this lateral olfactory area and its many connections with the limbic behavioral system cause a person to develop an absolute aversion to foods that have caused nausea and vomiting.",
          "An important feature of the lateral olfactory area is that many signal pathways from this area also feed directly into an older part of the cerebral cortex called the paleocortex in the anteromedial portion of the temporal lobe. This area is the only area of the entire cerebral cortex where sensory signals pass directly to the cortex without passing first through the thalamus.",
          "The Newer Pathway. A newer olfactory pathway that passes through the thalamus, passing to the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus and then to the lateroposterior quadrant of the orbitofrontale cortex, has been found. On the basis of studies in monkeys, this newer system probably helps in the conscious analysis of odor.",
          "Summary. Thus, there appear to be a primitive olfactory system that subserves the basic olfactory reflexes, a less old system that provides automatic but partially learned control of food intake and aversion to toxic and unhealthy foods, and a newer system that is comparable to most of the other cortical sensory systems and is used for con- scious perception and analysis of olfaction.",
          "Centrifugal Control of Activity in the Olfactory Bulb by the Central Nervous System. Many nerve fibers that originate in the olfactory portions of the brain pass from the brain in the outward direction into the olfacto- ry tract to the olfactory bulb (i.e., centrifugally from the brain to the periphery). These nerve fibers terminate on a large number of small granule cells located among the mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. The granule cells send inhibitory signals to the mitral and tufted cells. This inhibitory feedback may be a means for sharpening a person's specific ability to distinguish one odor from another."

          "In this chapter, we discuss spinal cord control of mus- cle function. Without the special neuronal circuits of the cord, even the most complex motor control systems in the brain could not cause any purposeful muscle movement. For example, there is no neuronal circuit anywhere in the brain that causes the specific to-and-fro movements of the legs that are required in walking. Instead, the circuits for these movements are in the cord, and the brain sim- ply sends command signals to the spinal cord to set into motion the walking process.",
          "Let us not belittle the role of the brain. The brain gives directions that control the sequential cord activities—for example, to promote turning movements when they are required, to lean the body forward during acceleration, to change the movements from walking to jumping as needed, and to monitor continuously and control equi- librium. All this is done through “analytical” and “com- mand” signals generated in the brain. However, the many neuronal circuits of the spinal cord that are the objects of the commands are also required. These circuits provide all but a small fraction of the direct control of the muscles."

Sensory signals enter the cord almost entirely through the sensory roots, also known as the posterior or dorsal roots. After entering the cord, every sensory signal travels to two separate destinations: one branch of the sensory nerve terminates almost immediately in the gray matter of the cord and elicits local segmental cord reflexes and other local effects; another branch transmits signals to higher levels of the nervous system—that is, to higher levels in the cord, to the brain stem, or even to the cerebral cortex, as described in earlier chapters.",
          "Each segment of the spinal cord (at the level of each spinal nerve) has several million neurons in its gray mat- ter. Aside from the sensory relay neurons discussed in Chapters 48 and 49, the other neurons are of two types: (1) anterior motor neurons and (2) interneurons.",
          "Anterior Motor Neurons. Located in each segment of the anterior horns of the cord gray matter are several thousand neurons that are 50 to 100% larger than most of the others and are called anterior motor neurons (Fig- ure 55-2). They give rise to the nerve fibers that leave the cord by way of the anterior roots and directly innervate the skeletal muscle fibers. The neurons are of two types, alpha motor neurons and gamma motor neurons.",
          "Alpha Motor Neurons. The alpha motor neurons give rise to large type A alpha (Aa) motor nerve fibers, aver- aging 14 micrometers in diameter; these fibers branch many times after they enter the muscle and innervate the large skeletal muscle fibers. Stimulation of a single alpha nerve fiber excites from three to several hundred skeletal muscle fibers, which are collectively called the motor unit. Transmission of nerve impulses into skeletal muscles and their stimulation of the muscle motor units are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.",
          "Gamma Motor Neurons. Along with the alpha motor neurons, which excite contraction of the skeletal muscle fibers, about one-half as many much smaller gamma mo- tor neurons are located in the spinal cord anterior horns. These gamma motor neurons transmit impulses through much smaller type A gamma (Ay) motor nerve fibers, av- eraging 5 micrometers in diameter, which go to small, spe- cial skeletal muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers, shown in Figures 55-2 and 55-3. These fibers constitute the middle of the muscle spindle, which helps control basic muscle “tone,’ as discussed later in this chapter.",
          "Interneurons. Interneurons are present in all areas of the cord gray matter—in the dorsal horns, the anterior horns, and the intermediate areas between them, as shown in Figure 55-1. These cells are about 30 times as numerous as the anterior motor neurons. They are small and highly excitable, often exhibiting spontaneous activity and ca- pable of firing as rapidly as 1500 times per second. They have many interconnections with one another, and many of them also synapse directly with the anterior motor neurons, as shown in Figure 55-1. The interconnections among the interneurons and anterior motor neurons are responsible for most of the integrative functions of the spinal cord that are discussed in the remainder of this chapter.",
          "Essentially all the different types of neuronal circuits described in Chapter 47 are found in the interneuron pool of cells of the spinal cord, including diverging, converging, repetitive-discharge, and other types of circuits. In this chapter, we examine many applications of these different circuits in the performance of specific reflex actions by the spinal cord.",
          "Only a few incoming sensory signals from the spinal nerves or signals from the brain terminate directly on the anterior motor neurons. Instead, almost all these signals are transmitted first through interneurons, where they are appropriately processed. Thus, in Figure 55-1, the corticospinal tract from the brain is shown to terminate almost entirely on spinal interneurons, where the signals from this tract are combined with signals from other spi- nal tracts or spinal nerves before finally converging on the anterior motor neurons to control muscle function.",
          "Renshaw Cells Transmit Inhibitory Signals to Surround- ing Motor Neurons. Also located in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, in close association with the motor neu- rons, are a large number of small neurons called Renshaw cells. Almost immediately after the anterior motor neuron axon leaves the body of the neuron, collateral branches from the axon pass to adjacent Renshaw cells. Renshaw cells are inhibitory cells that transmit inhibitory signals to the surrounding motor neurons. Thus, stimulation of each motor neuron tends to inhibit adjacent motor neurons, an effect called lateral inhibition. The motor system uses this lateral inhibition to focus, or sharpen, its signals in the same way that the sensory system uses the same principle to allow unabated transmission of the primary signal in the desired direction while suppressing the tendency for sig- nals to spread laterally.",
          "Multisegmental Connections From One Spinal Cord Level to Other Levels—Propriospinal Fibers. More than half of all the nerve fibers that ascend and descend in the spinal cord are propriospinal fibers. These fibers run from one seg- ment of the cord to another. In addition, as the sensory fibers enter the cord from the posterior cord roots, they bifurcate and branch both up and down the spinal cord; some of the branches transmit signals to only a segment or two, whereas others transmit signals to many segments. These ascend- ing and descending propriospinal fibers of the cord provide pathways for the multisegmental reflexes described later in this chapter, including reflexes that coordinate simultaneous movements in the forelimbs and hindlimbs."

That is, what is the length of the muscle, what is its instantaneous ten- sion, and how rapidly is its length or tension changing? To provide this information, the muscles and their ten- dons are supplied abundantly with two special types of sensory receptors: (1) muscle spindles (see Figure 55-2), which are distributed throughout the belly of the muscle and send information to the nervous system about muscle length or rate of change of length, and (2) Golgi tendon organs (see Figures 55-2 and 55-8), which are located in the muscle tendons and transmit information about ten- don tension or rate of change of tension.",

However, the central region of each of these fibers— that is, the area midway between its two ends—has few or no actin and myosin filaments. Therefore, this central portion does not contract when the ends do. Instead, it functions as a sensory receptor, as described later. The end portions that do contract are excited by small gamma motor nerve fibers that originate from small type A gamma motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord, as described earlier. These gamma motor nerve fibers are also called gamma efferent fibers, in contradistinction to the large alpha efferent fibers (type Aa nerve fibers) that innervate the extrafusal skeletal muscle.",

As shown in Figure 55-3 and in more detail in Figure 55- 4, sensory fibers originate in this area and are stimulated by stretching of this midportion of the spindle. One can readily see that the muscle spindle receptor can be excited in two ways: m 1. Lengthening the whole muscle stretches the mid- portion of the spindle and, therefore, excites the re- ceptor. m 2. Even if the length of the entire muscle does not change, contraction of the end portions of the spin- dle’s intrafusal fibers stretches the midportion of the spindle and therefore excites the receptor. m Two types of sensory endings, the primary afferent and secondary afferent endings, are found in this central recep- tor area of the muscle spindle.",
          "Primary Ending. In the center of the receptor area, a large sensory nerve fiber encircles the central portion of each intrafusal fiber, forming the primary afferent ending or annulospiral ending. This nerve fiber is a type Ia fiber averaging 17 micrometers in diameter, and it transmits sensory signals to the spinal cord at a velocity of 70 to 120 m/sec, as rapidly as any type of nerve fiber in the entire body.",
          "Secondary Ending. Usually one but sometimes two smaller sensory nerve fibers—type II fibers with an av- erage diameter of 8 micrometers—innervate the recep- tor region on one or both sides of the primary ending, as shown in Figures 55-3 and 55-4. This sensory ending is called the secondary afferent ending; sometimes it encir- cles the intrafusal fibers in the same way as the type Ia fiber, but often it spreads like branches on a bush.",
          "Division of the Intrafusal Fibers Into Nuclear Bag and Nuclear Chain Fibers—Dynamic and Static Responses of the Muscle Spindle. There are also two types of mus- cle spindle intrafusal fibers: (1) nuclear bag muscle fibers (one to three in each spindle), in which several muscle fiber nuclei are congregated in expanded “bags” in the central portion of the receptor area, as shown by the top fiber in Figure 55-4, and (2) nuclear chain fibers (three to nine), which are about half as large in diameter and half as long as the nuclear bag fibers and have nuclei aligned in a chain throughout the receptor area, as shown by the bot- tom fiber in the figure. The primary sensory nerve ending is excited by both the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers and the nuclear chain fibers. Conversely, the secondary ending is usually excited only by nuclear chain fibers. These rela- tions are shown in Figure 55-4.",
          "The Primary and the Secondary Endings Both Respond to the Length of the Receptor—“Static” Response. When the receptor portion of the muscle spindle is stretched slowly, the number of impulses transmitted from both the primary and the secondary endings increases al- most directly in proportion to the degree of stretching, and the endings continue to transmit these impulses for several minutes. This effect is called the static response of the spin- dle receptor, meaning that both the primary and secondary endings continue to transmit their signals for at least sev- eral minutes if the muscle spindle remains stretched.",
          "The Primary Ending (but Not the Secondary Ending) Responds to Rate of Change of Receptor Length— “Dynamic” Response. When the length of the spindle receptor increases suddenly, the primary ending (but not the secondary ending) is stimulated powerfully. This stim- ulus of the primary ending is called the dynamic response, which means that the primary ending responds extremely actively to a rapid rate of change in spindle length. Even when the length of a spindle receptor increases only a fraction of a micrometer for only a fraction of a second, the primary receptor transmits tremendous numbers of excess impulses to the large 17-micrometer sensory nerve fiber, but only while the length is actually increasing. As soon as the length stops increasing, this extra rate of im- pulse discharge returns to the level of the much smaller static response that is still present in the signal.",
          "Conversely, when the spindle receptor shortens, exactly opposite sensory signals occur. Thus, the primary ending sends extremely strong signals, either positive or negative, to the spinal cord to apprise it of any change in length of the spindle receptor.",
          "Control of Intensity of the Static and Dynamic Responses by the Gamma Motor Nerves. The gamma motor nerves to the muscle spindle can be divided into two types: gamma-dynamic (gamma-d) and gamma- static (gamma-s). The first of these gamma motor nerves excites mainly the nuclear bag intrafusal fibers, and the second excites mainly the nuclear chain intrafusal fibers. When the gamma-d fibers excite the nuclear bag fibers, the dynamic response of the muscle spindle becomes tre- mendously enhanced, whereas the static response is hard- ly affected. Conversely, stimulation of the gamma-s fibers, which excite the nuclear chain fibers, enhances the static response while having little influence on the dynamic re- sponse. Subsequent paragraphs illustrate that these two types of muscle spindle responses are important in differ- ent types of muscle control.",
          "Continuous Discharge of the Muscle Spindles Under Normal Conditions. Normally, when there is some de- gree of gamma nerve excitation, the muscle spindles emit sensory nerve impulses continuously. Stretching the mus- cle spindles increases the rate of firing, whereas short- ening the spindle decreases the rate of firing. Thus, the spindles can send to the spinal cord either positive signals (increased numbers of impulses to indicate stretch of a muscle) or negative signals (reduced numbers of impuls- es) to indicate that the muscle is unstretched."

Thus, this monosynaptic pathway allows a reflex signal to return with the shortest possible time delay back to the muscle after excitation of the spindle.

Thus, the reflex func- tions to oppose sudden changes in muscle length.",

This reflex is elicited by the continuous static receptor sig- nals transmitted by both primary and secondary endings. The importance of the static stretch reflex is that it causes the degree of muscle contraction to remain reasonably constant, except when the person's nervous system spe- cifically wills otherwise.",
          "“Damping” Function of the Dynamic and Static Stretch Reflexes in Smoothing Muscle Contraction. An especially important function of the stretch reflex is its ability to prevent oscillation or jerkiness of body move- ments, which is a damping, or smoothing, function.",
          "Signals from the spinal cord are often transmitted to a muscle in an unsmooth form, increasing in intensity for a few milliseconds, then decreasing in intensity, then changing to another intensity level, and so forth. When the muscle spindle apparatus is not functioning satisfac- torily, the muscle contraction is jerky during the course of such a signal. This effect is demonstrated in Figure 55-6. In part A, the muscle spindle reflex of the excited muscle is intact. Note that the contraction is relatively smooth, even though the motor nerve to the muscle is excited at a slow frequency of only eight signals per second. Part B illustrates the same experiment in an animal whose mus- cle spindle sensory nerves had been sectioned 3 months earlier. Note the unsmooth muscle contraction. Thus, Figure 55-6A graphically demonstrates the damping mechanism’s ability to smooth muscle contractions, even though the primary input signals to the muscle motor sys- tem may themselves be jerky. This effect can also be called a signal averaging function of the muscle spindle reflex."

For instance, if the muscle spindle did not contract and relax along with the large muscle fibers, the receptor portion of the spindle would sometimes be flail and sometimes be over- stretched, in neither instance operating under optimal conditions for spindle function."

          "Because the bulboreticular facilitatory area is particu- larly concerned with antigravity contractions, and because the antigravity muscles have an especially high density of muscle spindles, the gamma efferent mechanism is believed to be important for damping the movements of the different body parts during walking and running.",
          "The Muscle Spindle System Stabilizes Body Position During Tense Action. One of the most important func- tions of the muscle spindle system is to stabilize body posi- tion during tense motor action. To perform this function, the bulboreticular facilitatory region and its allied areas of the brain stem transmit excitatory signals through the gamma nerve fibers to the intrafusal muscle fibers of the muscle spindles. This action shortens the ends of the spin- dles and stretches the central receptor regions, thus in- creasing their signal output. However, if the spindles on both sides of each joint are activated at the same time, reflex excitation of the skeletal muscles on both sides of the joint also increases, producing tight, tense muscles opposing each other at the joint. The net effect is that the position of the joint becomes strongly stabilized, and any force that tends to move the joint from its current posi- tion is opposed by highly sensitized stretch reflexes oper- ating on both sides of the joint.",
          "Any time a person must perform a muscle function that requires a high degree of delicate and exact posi- tioning, excitation of the appropriate muscle spindles by signals from the bulboreticular facilitatory region of the brain stem stabilizes the positions of the major joints. This stabilization aids tremendously in performing the addi- tional detailed voluntary movements (of fingers or other body parts) required for intricate motor procedures."

          "Knee Jerk and Other Muscle Jerks Can Be Used to As- sess Sensitivity of Stretch Reflexes. Clinically, a method used to determine the sensitivity of the stretch reflexes is to elicit the knee jerk and other muscle jerks. The knee jerk can be elicited by simply striking the patellar tendon lightly with a reflex hammer; this action instantaneously stretches the quadriceps muscle and excites a dynamic stretch reflex that causes the lower leg to “jerk” forward (Video 55-2). The upper part of Figure 55-7 shows a myogram from the quadriceps muscle recorded during a knee jerk.",
          "Similar reflexes can be obtained from almost any muscle of the body either by striking the tendon of the muscle or by striking the belly of the muscle itself. In other words, sud- den stretch of muscle spindles is all that is required to elicit a dynamic stretch reflex.",
          "The muscle jerks are used by neurologists to assess the degree of facilitation of spinal cord centers. When large numbers of facilitatory impulses are being transmitted from the upper regions of the central nervous system into the cord, the muscle jerks are greatly exaggerated. Conversely, if the facilitatory impulses are depressed or abrogated, the muscle jerks are considerably weakened or absent. These reflexes are used most frequently in determining the pres- ence or absence of muscle spasticity caused by lesions in the motor areas of the brain or diseases that excite the bul- boreticular facilitatory area of the brain stem. Ordinarily, large lesions in the motor areas of the cerebral cortex but not in the lower motor control areas (especially lesions caused",
          "by strokes or brain tumors) cause greatly exaggerated mus- cle jerks in the muscles on the opposite side of the body.",
          "Clonus—Oscillation of Muscle Jerks. Under some conditions, the muscle jerks can oscillate, a phenomenon called clonus (see lower myogram, Figure 55-7). Oscilla- tion can be explained particularly well in relation to ankle clonus, as follows.",
          "If a person standing on the tip ends of the feet suddenly drops his or her body downward and stretches the gas- trocnemius muscles, stretch reflex impulses are transmit- ted from the muscle spindles into the spinal cord. These impulses reflexively excite the stretched muscle, which lifts the body up again. After a fraction of a second, the reflex contraction of the muscle dies out and the body falls again, thus stretching the spindles a second time. Again, a dynam- ic stretch reflex lifts the body, but this too dies out after a fraction of a second, and the body falls once more to begin a new cycle. In this way, the stretch reflex of the gastrocne- mius muscle continues to oscillate, often for long periods, which is clonus.",
          "Clonus ordinarily occurs only when the stretch reflex is highly sensitized by facilitatory impulses from the brain. For instance, in a decerebrate animal in which the stretch reflexes are highly facilitated, clonus develops readily. To determine the degree of facilitation of the spinal cord, neu- rologists test patients for clonus by suddenly stretching a muscle and applying a steady stretching force to it. If clonus occurs, the degree of facilitation is certain to be high."

About 10 to 15 muscle fibers are usually con- nected to each Golgi tendon organ, and the organ is stimu- lated when this small bundle of muscle fibers is “tensed” by contracting or stretching the muscle. Thus, the major difference in excitation of the Golgi tendon organ versus the muscle spindle is that the spindle detects muscle length and changes in muscle length, whereas the tendon organ detects muscle tension as reflected by the tension in itself.",

Signals from the receptors are transmitted through a sensory afferent nerve fiber that excites an inhibitory interneuron in the spinal cord, inhibiting anterior motor neuron activity, causing muscle relaxation, and pro- tecting the muscle against excessive tension.",
          "The tendon organ, like the primary receptor of the muscle spindle, has both a dynamic response and a static response, reacting intensely when the muscle tension suddenly increases (the dynamic response) but settling down within a fraction of a second to a lower level of steady-state firing that is almost directly proportional to the muscle tension (the static response). Thus, Golgi tendon organs provide the nervous system with instanta- neous information on the degree of tension in each small segment of each muscle.",
          "Transmission of Impulses From the Tendon Organ Into the Central Nervous System. Signals from the tendon organ are transmitted through large, rapidly con- ducting type Ib nerve fibers that average 16 micrometers in diameter, only slightly smaller than those from the primary endings of the muscle spindle. These fibers, like those from the primary spindle endings, transmit signals into local areas of the cord and, after synapsing in a dorsal horn of the cord, through long fiber pathways such as the spinocerebellar tracts into the cerebellum and through still other tracts to the cerebral cortex. The local cord sig- nal excites a single inhibitory interneuron that inhibits the anterior motor neuron. This local circuit directly inhibits the individual muscle without affecting adjacent muscles. The relation between signals to the brain and function of the cerebellum and other parts of the brain for muscle control is discussed in Chapter 57.",
          "The Tendon Reflex Prevents Excessive Tension on the Muscle. When the Golgi tendon organs of a muscle ten- don are stimulated by increased tension in the connecting muscle, signals are transmitted to the spinal cord to cause reflex effects in the respective muscle. This reflex is entire- ly inhibitory. Thus, this reflex provides a negative feedback mechanism that prevents the development of too much tension on the muscle.",
          "When tension on the muscle—and therefore on the tendon—becomes extreme, the inhibitory effect from the tendon organ can be so great that it leads to a sud- den reaction in the spinal cord that causes instantaneous relaxation of the entire muscle. This effect is called the lengthening reaction; it is probably a protective mecha- nism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachments to the bone.",
          "Possible Role of the Tendon Reflex to Equalize Contractile Force Among the Muscle Fibers. Another likely function of the Golgi tendon reflex is to equalize contractile forces of the separate muscle fibers. That is, the fibers that exert excess tension become inhibited by the reflex, whereas those that exert too little tension be- come more excited because of the absence of reflex inhi- bition. This phenomenon spreads the muscle load over all the fibers and prevents damage in isolated areas of a mus- cle where small numbers of fibers might be overloaded."

For instance, the dorsal spi- nocerebellar tracts carry instantaneous information from the muscle spindles and the Golgi tendon organs directly to the cerebellum at conduction velocities approaching 120 m/sec, the most rapid conduction anywhere in the brain or spinal cord. Additional pathways transmit similar information into the reticular regions of the brain stem and, to a lesser extent, all the way to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex.

          "In the spinal or decerebrate animal, almost any type of cutaneous sensory stimulus from a limb is likely to cause the flexor muscles of the limb to contract, thereby with- drawing the limb from the stimulating object. This reflex is called the flexor reflex.",
          "In its classic form, the flexor reflex is elicited most powerfully by stimulation of pain endings, such as by a pinprick, heat, or a wound, for which reason it is also called a nociceptive reflex, or simply a pain reflex. Stimu- lation of touch receptors can also elicit a weaker and less prolonged flexor reflex.",
          "If some part of the body other than one of the limbs is painfully stimulated, that part will similarly be withdrawn from the stimulus, but the reflex may not be confined to flexor muscles, even though it is basically the same type of reflex. Therefore, the many patterns of these reflexes in the different areas of the body are called withdrawal reflexes.",
          "Neuronal Mechanism of the Flexor Reflex. The left- hand portion of Figure 55-9 shows the neuronal path- ways for the flexor reflex. In this instance, a painful stimu- lus is applied to the hand; as a result, the flexor muscles of the upper arm become excited and withdraw the hand from the painful stimulus.",
          "The pathways for eliciting the flexor reflex do not pass directly to the anterior motor neurons but instead pass first into the spinal cord interneuron pool of neurons and only secondarily to the motor neurons. The shortest pos- sible circuit is a three- or four-neuron pathway; however, most of the signals of the reflex traverse many more neu- rons and involve the following basic types of circuits: (1) diverging circuits to spread the reflex to the necessary muscles for withdrawal; (2) circuits to inhibit the antago- nist muscles, called reciprocal inhibition circuits; and (3) circuits to cause afterdischarge that lasts many fractions of a second after the stimulus is over.",
          "Figure 55-10 shows a typical myogram from a flexor muscle during a flexor reflex. Within a few milliseconds after a pain sensory nerve begins to be stimulated, the flexor response appears. Then, in the next few seconds, the reflex begins to fatigue, which is characteristic of essentially all complex integrative reflexes of the spinal cord. Finally, after the stimulus is over, the contraction of the muscle returns toward the baseline, but because of afterdischarge, it takes many milliseconds for this con- traction to occur. The duration of afterdischarge depends on the intensity of the sensory stimulus that elicited the reflex; a weak tactile stimulus causes almost no afterdis- charge, but after a strong pain stimulus, the afterdischarge may last for a second or more.",
          "The afterdischarge that occurs in the flexor reflex almost certainly results from both types of repetitive discharge circuits discussed in Chapter 47. Electrophysi- ological studies indicate that immediate afterdischarge, lasting for about 6 to 8 milliseconds, results from repeti- tive firing of the excited interneurons. Also, prolonged afterdischarge occurs after strong pain stimuli, almost certainly resulting from recurrent pathways that initiate oscillation in reverberating interneuron circuits. These, in turn, transmit impulses to the anterior motor neurons, sometimes for several seconds after the incoming sensory signal is over.",
          "Thus, the flexor reflex is appropriately organized to withdraw a pained or otherwise irritated part of the body from a stimulus. Further, because of afterdischarge, the reflex can hold the irritated part away from the stimulus for 0.1 to 3 seconds after the irritation is over. During this time, other reflexes and actions of the central nervous system can move the entire body away from the painful stimulus.",
          "Pattern of Withdrawal During Flexor Reflex. The pat- tern of withdrawal that results when the flexor reflex is elicited depends on which sensory nerve is stimu- lated. Thus, a pain stimulus on the inward side of the arm elicits not only contraction of the flexor muscles of the arm but also contraction of abductor muscles to pull the arm outward. In other words, the cord inte- grative centers cause contraction of the muscles that can most effectively remove the pained part of the body away from the object causing the pain. Although this principle applies to any part of the body, it is especially applicable to the limbs because of their highly devel- oped flexor reflexes."

The right-hand portion of Figure 55-9 shows the neu- ronal circuit responsible for the crossed extensor reflex, demonstrating that signals from sensory nerves cross to the opposite side of the cord to excite extensor muscles. Because the crossed extensor reflex usually does not be- gin until 200 to 500 milliseconds after onset of the initial pain stimulus, it is certain that many interneurons are involved in the circuit between the incoming sensory neuron and the motor neurons of the opposite side of the cord responsible for the crossed extension. After the pain- ful stimulus is removed, the crossed extensor reflex has an even longer period of afterdischarge than does the flexor reflex. Again, it is presumed that this prolonged afterdis- charge results from reverberating circuits among the in- terneuronal cells.",

Likewise, reciprocal relations often exist between the muscles on the two sides of the body, as exemplified by the flexor and extensor muscle reflexes described earlier.",

In this instance, a moderate but prolonged flexor reflex is elicited from one limb of the body; while this reflex is still being elicited, a stronger flexor reflex is elicited in the limb on the opposite side of the body. This stronger reflex sends reciprocal inhibitory signals to the first limb and depresses its degree of flexion.

Indeed, an animal with a well-healed transected thoracic cord between the lev- els for forelimb and hindlimb innervation can right itself from the lying position and even walk using its hindlimbs in addition to its forelimbs. In the case of an opossum with a similar transection of the thoracic cord, the walk- ing movements of the hindlimbs are hardly different from those in a normal opossum, except that the hindlimb walking movements are not synchronized with those of the forelimbs."

In most nonpri- mates, excitability of the cord centers returns essentially to normal within a few hours to a day or so, but in people, the return is often delayed for several weeks and occasionally is never complete; conversely, sometimes recovery is excessive, with resultant hyperexcitability of some or all cord functions.",

At onset of spinal shock, the arterial blood pressure falls almost instantly and drastically—sometimes to as low as 40 mm Hg—thus demonstrating that sympathetic nervous system activity becomes blocked almost to extinction. The pressure ordinarily returns to normal within a few days, even in humans. m 2. All skeletal muscle reflexes integrated in the spinal cord are blocked during the initial stages of shock. In lower animals, a few hours to a few days are required for these reflexes to return to normal; in humans, 2 weeks to sev- eral months are sometimes required. In both animals and humans, some reflexes may eventually become hy- perexcitable, particularly if a few facilitatory pathways remain intact between the brain and the cord while the remainder of the spinal cord is transected. The first re- flexes to return are the stretch reflexes, followed in or- der by the progressively more complex reflexes: flexor reflexes, postural antigravity reflexes, and remnants of stepping reflexes. m 3.

          "Figure 56-1 lists the approximate topographical repre- sentations of the different muscle areas of the body in the primary motor cortex, beginning with the face and mouth region near the sylvian fissure; the arm and hand area, in the midportion of the primary motor cortex; the trunk, near the apex of the brain; and the leg and foot areas, in the part of the primary motor cortex that dips into the longitudinal fissure. This topographical organization is demonstrated even more graphically in Figure 56-2, which shows the degrees of representation of the different muscle areas as mapped by Penfield and Rasmussen. This mapping was done by electrically stimulating the different areas of the motor cortex in human beings were undergo- ing neurosurgery. Note that more than half of the entire primary motor cortex is concerned with controlling the muscles of the hands and the muscles of speech. Point stimulation in these hand and speech motor areas on rare occasion causes contraction of a single muscle, but most often, stimulation contracts a group of muscles. To express this in another way, excitation of a single motor cortex neuron usually excites a specific movement rather than one specific muscle. To do this, it excites a “pattern” of separate muscles, each of which contributes its own direction and strength of muscle movement."

It extends inferiorly into the sylvian fissure and superiorly into the longitudinal fissure, where it abuts the supple- mentary motor area, which has functions similar to those of the premotor area. The topographical organization of the premotor cortex is roughly the same as that of the primary motor cortex, with the mouth and face areas located most laterally; as one moves upward, the hand, arm, trunk, and leg areas are encountered.",
          "Nerve signals generated in the premotor area cause much more complex “patterns” of movement than the discrete patterns generated in the primary motor cortex. For example, the pattern may be to position the shoul- ders and arms so that the hands are properly oriented to perform specific tasks. To achieve these results, the most anterior part of the premotor area first develops a “motor image” of the total muscle movement that is to be performed. Then, in the posterior premotor cortex, this image excites each successive pattern of muscle activity required to achieve the image. This posterior part of the premotor cortex sends its signals either directly to the pri- mary motor cortex to excite specific muscles or, often, by way of the basal ganglia and thalamus back to the primary motor cortex.",
          "A special class of neurons called mirror neurons becomes active when a person performs a specific motor task or when he or she observes the same task performed by others. Thus, the activity of these neurons “mirrors” the behavior of another person as though the observer was performing the specific motor task. Brain imaging studies indicate that these neurons transform sensory representations of acts that are heard or seen into motor representations of these acts. Many neurophysiologists believe that these mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people and for learn- ing new skills by imitation. Thus, the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and primary motor cortex consti- tute a complex overall system for the control of complex patterns of coordinated muscle activity."

These fibers synapse in the lower portion of the red nucleus, the mag- nocellular portion, which contains large neurons similar in size to the Betz cells in the motor cortex. These large neurons then give rise to the rubrospinal tract, which crosses to the opposite side in the lower brain stem and follows a course immediately adjacent and anterior to the corticospinal tract into the lateral columns of the spinal cord.",

The mag- nocellular portion of the red nucleus has a somatographic representation of all the muscles of the body, as does the motor cortex. Therefore, stimulation of a single point in this portion of the red nucleus causes contraction of ei- ther a single muscle or a small group of muscles. However, the fineness of representation of the different muscles is far less developed than in the motor cortex, especially in human beings, who have relatively small red nuclei.",

There- fore, the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts together are called the lateral motor system of the cord, in contradis- tinction to a vestibuloreticulospinal system, which lies mainly medially in the cord and is called the medial motor system of the cord, as discussed later in this chapter."

If a strong signal is sent to a mus- cle to cause initial rapid contraction, then a much weaker continuing signal can maintain the contraction for long periods thereafter. This process is the usual manner in which excitation is provided to cause muscle contrac- tions. To provide this excitation, each column of cells excites two populations of pyramidal cell neurons, one called dynamic neurons and the other static neurons. The dynamic neurons are excited at a high rate for a short pe- riod at the beginning of a contraction, causing the initial rapid development of force. The static neurons then fire at a much slower rate, but they continue firing at this slow rate to maintain the force of contraction as long as the contraction is required.",

In the case of the muscle spindles, if the fusimotor muscle fibers in the spindles contract more than the large skeletal muscle fibers contract, the central portions of the spindles become stretched and, therefore, excited. Signals from these spindles then return rapidly to the pyramidal cells in the motor cortex signal them that the large muscle fibers have not contracted enough. The pyramidal cells further excite the muscle, helping its contraction to catch up with the contraction of the muscle spindles. In the case of the tactile receptors, if the muscle contraction causes compression of the skin against an object, such as com- pression of the fingers around an object being grasped, the signals from the skin receptors can, if necessary, cause further excitation of the muscles and, therefore, increase the tightness of the hand grasp."

From Chapter 55, recall that the spinal cord can provide certain specific reflex patterns of movement in response to sensory nerve stimulation. Many of these same patterns are also important when the cord’s ante- rior motor neurons are excited by signals from the brain. For example, the stretch reflex is functional at all times, helping to damp any oscillations of the motor movements initiated from the brain. This reflex probably also provides at least part of the motive power required to cause mus- cle contractions when the intrafusal fibers of the muscle spindles contract more than the large skeletal muscle fib- ers, thus eliciting reflex “servo-assist” stimulation of the muscle, in addition to the direct stimulation by the corti- cospinal fibers.",

Most lesions of the motor cortex, especially those caused by a stroke, involve not only the primary motor cortex but also adjacent parts of the brain, such as the basal ganglia. In these cases, muscle spasm almost invariably occurs in the afflicted muscle areas on the opposite side of the body (because the motor path- ways cross to the opposite side). This spasm results mainly from damage to accessory pathways from the nonpyramidal portions of the motor cortex. These pathways normally in- hibit the vestibular and reticular brain stem motor nuclei. When these nuclei cease their state of inhibition (ie., are “disinhibited”), they become spontaneously active and cause excessive spastic tone in the involved muscles, as we discuss more fully later in this chapter.

          "“Maculae”—Sensory Organs of the Utricle and Sac- cule for Detecting Orientation of the Head With Re- spect to Gravity. Located on the inside surface of each utricle and saccule, shown in the top diagram of Figure 56-9, is a small sensory area slightly greater than 2 mil- limeters in diameter called a macula. The macula of the utricle lies mainly in the horizontal plane on the inferior surface of the utricle and plays an important role in deter- mining orientation of the head when the head is upright. Conversely, the macula of the saccule is located mainly in a vertical plane and signals head orientation when the person is lying down.",
          "Each macula is covered by a gelatinous layer in which many small calcium carbonate crystals called statoconia are embedded. Also in the macula are thousands of hair cells, one of which is shown in Figure 56-10; these hair cells project cilia up into the gelatinous layer. The bases and sides of the hair cells synapse with sensory endings of the vestibular nerve.",
          "The calcified statoconia have a specific gravity two to three times the specific gravity of the surrounding fluid and tissues. The weight of the statoconia bends the cilia in the direction of gravitational pull.",
          "Directional Sensitivity of the Hair Cells—Kinocilium. Each hair cell has about 100 small cilia called stereocilia, plus one large cilium, the kinocilium, as shown in Figure 56-10. The kinocilium is always located to one side, and the stereocilia become progressively shorter toward the other side of the cell. Minute filamentous attachments, al- most invisible even to the electron microscope, connect the tip of each stereocilium to the next longer stereocili- um and, finally, to the kinocilium.",
          "Because of these attachments, when the stereocilia bend in the direction of the kinocilium, the filamentous attachments tug in sequence on the stereocilia, pulling them outward from the cell body. This movement opens several hundred cation channels in the neuronal cell membrane around the bases of the stereocilia, and these channels are capable of conducting large numbers of posi- tive ions. Therefore, positive ions pour into the cell from the surrounding endolymphatic fluid, causing receptor membrane depolarization. Conversely, bending the pile of stereocilia in the opposite direction (backward, away from the kinocilium) reduces the tension on the attach- ments; this movement closes the ion channels, thus caus- ing receptor hyperpolarization.",
          "Under normal resting conditions, the nerve fibers lead- ing from the hair cells transmit continuous nerve impulses at a rate of about 100 per second. When the stereocilia are bent toward the kinocilium, the impulse traffic increases, often to several hundred per second; conversely, bending the cilia away from the kinocilium decreases the impulse traffic, often turning it off completely. Therefore, as the orientation of the head in space changes and the weight of the statoconia bends the cilia, appropriate signals are transmitted to the brain to control equilibrium.",
          "In each macula, each of the hair cells is oriented in a dif- ferent direction so that some of the hair cells are stimulated when the head bends forward, some are stimulated when it bends backward, others are stimulated when it bends to one side, and so forth. Therefore, a different pattern of exci- tation occurs in the macular nerve fibers for each orienta- tion of the head in the gravitational field. It is this “pattern” that apprises the brain of the head’s orientation in space.",
          "Semicircular Ducts. The three semicircular ducts in each vestibular apparatus, known as the anterior, posterior, and lateral (horizontal) semicircular ducts, are arranged at right angles to one another so that they represent all three planes in space. When the head is bent forward about 30 degrees, the lateral semicircular ducts are approximately horizontal with respect to the surface of the Earth; the anterior ducts are in vertical planes that project forward and 45 degrees outward, whereas the posterior ducts are in vertical planes that project backward and 45 degrees outward.",
          "Each semicircular duct has an enlargement at one of its ends called the ampulla, and the ducts and ampulla are filled with a fluid called endolymph. Flow of this fluid through one of the ducts and through its ampulla excites the sensory organ of the ampulla in the following man- ner: Figure 56-11 shows a small crest in each ampulla called a crista ampullaris. On top of this crista is a loose gelatinous tissue mass, the cupula. When a person's head begins to rotate in any direction, the inertia of the fluid in one or more of the semicircular ducts causes the fluid to remain stationary while the semicircular duct rotates with the head. This process causes fluid to flow from the duct and through the ampulla, bending the cupula to one side, as demonstrated by the position of the col- ored cupula in Figure 56-11. Rotation of the head in the opposite direction causes the cupula to bend to the opposite side.",
          "Hundreds of cilia from hair cells located on the ampul- lary crest are projected into the cupula. The kinocilia of these hair cells are all oriented in the same direction in the cupula, and bending the cupula in that direction causes depolarization of the hair cells, whereas bending it in the opposite direction hyperpolarizes the cells. Then, from the hair cells, appropriate signals are sent via the vestibu- lar nerve to apprise the central nervous system of a change in rotation of the head and the rate of change in each of the three planes of space."

          "It is especially important that the hair cells are all oriented in different directions in the maculae of the utricles and saccules so that with different positions of the head, different hair cells become stimulated. The “patterns” of stimulation of the dif- ferent hair cells apprise the brain of the position of the head with respect to the pull of gravity. In turn, the vestibular, cer- ebellar, and reticular motor nerve systems of the brain excite appropriate postural muscles to maintain proper equilibrium.",
          "This utricle and saccule system functions extremely effectively for maintaining equilibrium when the head is in the near-vertical position. Indeed, a person can deter- mine as little as half a degree of disequilibrium when the body leans from the precise upright position.",
          "Detection of Linear Acceleration by the Utricle and Sac- cule Maculae. When the body is suddenly thrust forward— that is, when the body accelerates—the statoconia, which have greater mass inertia than the surrounding fluid, fall backward on the hair cell cilia, and information of disequi- librium is sent into the nervous centers, causing the person to feel as though he or she were falling backward. This sensa- tion automatically causes the person to lean forward until the resulting anterior shift of the statoconia exactly equals the tendency for the statoconia to fall backward because of the acceleration. At this point, the nervous system senses a state of proper equilibrium and leans the body forward no farther. Thus, the maculae operate to maintain equilibrium during linear acceleration in exactly the same manner as they operate during static equilibrium.",
          "The maculae do not operate for the detection of linear velocity. When runners first begin to run, they must lean far forward to keep from falling backward because of initial acceleration, but once they have achieved running speed, if they were running in a vacuum, they would not have to lean forward. When running in air, they lean forward to maintain equilibrium only because of air resistance against their bodies; in this case, it is not the maculae that make them lean but air pressure acting on pressure end-organs in the skin, which initiate appropriate equilibrium adjust- ments to prevent falling."

        "paragraphs": [
          "When the head suddenly begins to rotate in any direc- tion (called angular acceleration), the endolymph in the semicircular ducts, because of its inertia, tends to remain stationary while the semicircular ducts turn. This mecha- nism causes relative fluid flow in the ducts in the direction opposite to head rotation.",
          "Figure 56-12 shows a typical discharge signal from a sin- gle hair cell in the crista ampullaris when an animal is rotated for 40 seconds, demonstrating the following: (1) even when the cupula is in its resting position, the hair cell emits a tonic discharge of about 100 impulses per second; (2) when the animal begins to rotate, the hairs bend to one side, and the rate of discharge increases greatly; and (3) with continued rotation, the excess discharge of the hair cell gradually sub- sides back to the resting level during the next few seconds.",
          "The reason for this adaptation of the receptor is that within the first few seconds of rotation, back resistance to the flow of fluid in the semicircular duct and past the bent cupula causes the endolymph to begin rotating as rapidly as the semicircular canal itself. Then, in another 5 to 20 seconds, the cupula slowly returns to its resting position in the middle of the ampulla because of its own elastic recoil.",
          "When the rotation suddenly stops, exactly opposite effects take place: The endolymph continues to rotate while the semicircular duct stops. This time, the cupula bends in the opposite direction, causing the hair cell to stop discharging entirely. After another few seconds, the endolymph stops moving and the cupula gradually returns to its resting position, thus allowing hair cell discharge to return to its normal tonic level, as shown at the right in Figure 56-12. Thus, the semicircular duct transmits a signal of one polarity when the head begins to rotate and of opposite polarity when it stops rotating.",
          "“Predictive” Function of the Semicircular Duct System in the Maintenance of Equilibrium. Because the semicircular ducts do not detect that the body is off balance in the forward direction, in the side direction, or in the backward direction, one might ask, “What is the function of the semicircular ducts in the maintenance of equilibrium?” All they detect is that the person's head is beginning or stopping to rotate in one direction or another. Therefore, the function of the semicircular ducts is not to maintain static equilibrium or to main- tain equilibrium during steady directional or rotational movements. Yet, loss of function of the semicircular ducts does cause a person to have poor equilibrium when attempting to perform rapid, intricate changing body movements.",
          "The function of the semicircular ducts can be explained by the following illustration: if a person is running forward rapidly and then suddenly begins to turn to one side, he or she will fall off balance a frac- tion of a second later unless appropriate corrections are made ahead of time. However, the maculae of the utricle and saccule cannot detect that the person is off balance until after the loss of balance has occurred. The semicircular ducts, however, will have already detected that the person is turning, and this information can eas- ily apprise the central nervous system of the fact that the person will fall off balance within the next fraction of a second or so unless some anticipatory correction is made.",
          "In other words, the semicircular duct mechanism pre- dicts that disequilibrium is going to occur and thereby causes the equilibrium centers to make appropriate anticipatory preventive adjustments, which helps the person maintain balance before the situation can be corrected.",
          "Removal of the flocculonodular lobes of the cerebel- lum prevents normal detection of semicircular duct signals but has less effect on detecting macular signals. It is especially interesting that the cerebellum serves as a “predictive” organ for most rapid movements of the body, as well as for those involving equilibrium. These other functions of the cerebellum are discussed in Chap- ter 57."

In addition, the eyes would be of little use in detecting an image unless they remained fixed on each object long enough to gain a clear image. Fortunately, each time the head is suddenly ro- tated, signals from the semicircular ducts cause the eyes to rotate in a direction equal and opposite to the rotation of the head. This movement results from reflexes transmitted through the vestibular nuclei and the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the oculomotor nuclei. These reflexes are de- scribed in Chapter 52."

Therefore, it is essential that the nervous centers also receive appro- priate information about the orientation of the head with respect to the body. This information is transmitted from the proprioceptors of the neck and body directly to the ves- tibular and reticular nuclei in the brain stem and indirectly by way of the cerebellum.",
          "Among the most important proprioceptive information needed for the maintenance of equilibrium is that transmit- ted by joint receptors of the neck. When the head is leaned in one direction by bending the neck, impulses from the neck proprioceptors keep the signals originating in the vestibular apparatus from giving the person a sense of disequi- librium. They perform this function by transmitting signals that exactly oppose the signals transmitted from the ves- tibular apparatus. However, when the entire body leans in one direction, the impulses from the vestibular apparatus are not opposed by signals from the neck proprioceptors; therefore, in this case, the person does perceive a change in equilibrium status of the entire body.",
          "Proprioceptive and Exteroceptive Information From Other Parts of the Body. Proprioceptive information from parts of the body other than the neck is also important in the maintenance of equilibrium.

          "Exteroceptive information is especially necessary for the maintenance of equilibrium when a person is running. ‘The air pressure against the front of the body signals that a force is opposing the body in a direction different from that caused by gravitational pull; as a result, the person leans forward to oppose this force.",
          "Importance of Visual Information for Maintaining Equi- librium. After destruction of the vestibular apparatus, and even after loss of most proprioceptive information from the body, a person can still use the visual mechanisms reason- ably effectively for maintaining equilibrium. Even a slight linear or rotational movement of the body instantaneously shifts the visual images on the retina, and this information is relayed to the equilibrium centers. Some people with bi- lateral destruction of the vestibular apparatus have almost normal equilibrium as long as their eyes are open, and all motions are performed slowly. However, when moving rap- idly or when the eyes are closed, equilibrium is immediately lost."

That is, severe injury to either the lobes or the ducts causes loss of dynamic equilib- rium during rapid changes in direction of motion but does not seriously disturb equilibrium under static conditions. It is believed that the uvula of the cerebellum plays a similar important role in static equilibrium.",
          "Signals transmitted upward in the brain stem from both the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum via the medial longitudinal fasciculus cause corrective movements of the eyes every time the head rotates, so the eyes remain fixed on a specific visual object. Signals also pass upward (either through this same tract or through reticular tracts) to the cerebral cortex, terminating in a primary cortical center for equilibrium located in the parietal lobe deep in the sylvian fissure on the opposite side of the fissure from the auditory area of the superior temporal gyrus.

Removal of the cerebellum, however, causes body movements to become highly abnormal. The cerebellum is especially vital during rapid muscular activ- ities such as running, typing, playing the piano, and even talking. Loss of this area of the brain can cause almost total lack of coordination of these activities, even though its loss does not cause paralysis of any muscles.",
          "How can the cerebellum be so important when it has no direct ability to cause muscle contraction? The answer is that it helps sequence and monitor motor activities and makes corrective adjustments while activities are being executed so that they will conform to the motor signals directed by the cerebral motor cortex and other parts of the brain.",
          "The cerebellum receives continuously updated infor- mation about the desired sequence of muscle contrac- tions from the brain motor control areas; it also receives continuous sensory information from the peripheral parts of the body, giving sequential changes in the sta- tus of each part of the body—its position, rate of move- ment, forces acting on it, and so forth. The cerebellum then compares the actual movements as depicted by the peripheral sensory feedback information with the move- ments intended by the motor system. If the two do not compare favorably, then instantaneous subconscious corrective signals are transmitted back into the motor system to increase or decrease the levels of activation of specific muscles.",

Note, down the center of the cerebellum, a narrow band called the vermis, which is separated from the remainder of the cerebellum by shallow grooves. Most cerebellar control functions for muscle movements of the axial body, neck, shoulders, and hips are located in this area.",

The interme- diate zone of the hemisphere is concerned with controlling muscle contractions in the distal portions of the upper and lower limbs, especially the hands, fingers, feet, and toes. The lateral zone of the hemisphere operates at a much more remote level because this area joins with the cerebral cor- tex in the overall planning of sequential motor movements. Without this lateral zone, most discrete motor activities of the body lose their appropriate timing and sequencing and therefore become uncoordinated, as we discuss more fully later in this chapter.",
          "Topographical Representation of the Body in the Ver- mis and Intermediate Zones. In the same manner that the cerebral sensory cortex, motor cortex, basal ganglia, red nuclei, and reticular formation all have topographical rep- resentations of the different parts of the body, so does the vermis and intermediate zones of the cerebellum. Figure 57-3 shows two such representations. Note that the axial portions of the body lie in the vermis part of the cerebel- lum, whereas the limbs and facial regions lie in the interme- diate zones. These topographical representations receive afferent nerve signals from all the respective parts of the body, as well as from corresponding topographical motor areas in the cerebral cortex and brain stem. In turn, they send motor signals back to the same respective topographi- cal areas of the cerebral motor cortex, as well as to topo- graphical areas of the red nucleus and reticular formation in the brain stem.",

Instead, they are excited mainly by motor signals arriving in the ante- rior horns of the spinal cord from (1) the brain through the corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts and (2) the in- ternal motor pattern generators in the cord itself. Thus, this ventral fiber pathway tells the cerebellum which motor signals have arrived at the anterior horns; this feedback is called the efference copy of the anterior horn motor drive.",

Thus, all in- put signals that enter the cerebellum eventually end in the deep nuclei in the form of initial excitatory signals followed a fraction of a second later by inhibitory signals. From the deep nuclei, output signals leave the cerebellum and are distributed to other parts of the brain.",

This circuit functions in close asso- ciation with the equilibrium apparatus and brain stem vestibular nuclei to control equilibrium, as well as in as- sociation with the reticular formation of the brain stem to control the postural attitudes of the body. It was dis- cussed in detail in Chapter 56 in relation to equilibrium. m 2.

This complex circuit mainly helps coordinate the reciprocal contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles in the peripheral portions of the limbs, especially in the hands, fingers, and thumbs. m 3. A pathway that begins in the cerebellar cortex of the lat- eral zone of the cerebellar hemisphere and then passes to the dentate nucleus, next to the ventrolateral and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus, and, finally, to the cerebral cortex.

          "The cerebellum has about 30 million nearly identical func- tional units, one of which is shown to the left in Figure 57-7. This functional unit centers on a single, very large Purkinje cell and on a corresponding deep nuclear cell.",
          "To the top and right in Figure 57-7, the three major layers of the cerebellar cortex are shown: the molecular layer, Purkinje cell layer, and granule cell layer. Beneath these cortical layers, in the center of the cerebellar mass, are the deep cerebellar nuclei that send output signals to other parts of the nervous system.",
          "Neuronal Circuit of the Functional Unit. Also shown in the left half of Figure 57-7 is the neuronal circuit of the functional unit, which is repeated with little varia- tion 30 million times in the cerebellum. The output from the functional unit is from a deep nuclear cell. This cell is continually under both excitatory and inhibitory influ- ences. The excitatory influences arise from direct connec- tions with afferent fibers that enter the cerebellum from the brain or the periphery. The inhibitory influence arises entirely from the Purkinje cell in the cortex of the cerebel- lum.",
          "he afferent inputs to the cerebellum are mainly of two types, one called the climbing fiber type and the other called the mossy fiber type.",
          "he climbing fibers all originate from the inferior olives of the medulla. There is one climbing fiber for about 5 to 10 Purkinje cells. After sending branches to several deep nuclear cells, the climbing fiber continues all the way to the outer layers of the cerebellar cortex, where it makes about 300 synapses with the soma and dendrites of each Purkinje cell. This climbing fiber is distinguished by the fact that a single impulse in it will always cause a single, prolonged (up to 1 second), peculiar type of action potential in each Pur- kinje cell with which it connects, beginning with a strong spike and followed by a trail of weakening secondary spikes. This action potential is called the complex spike.",
          "The mossy fibers are all the other fibers that enter the cerebellum from multiple sources—the higher brain, brain stem, and spinal cord. These fibers also send collaterals to excite the deep nuclear cells. They then proceed to the granule cell layer of the cortex, where they also synapse with hundreds to thousands of granule cells. In turn, the granule cells send extremely small axons, less than 1 micrometer in diameter, up to the molecular layer on the outer surface of the cerebel- lar cortex. Here the axons divide into two branches that extend 1 to 2 millimeters in each direction paral- lel to the folia. Many millions of these parallel nerve fibers exist because there are some 500 to 1000 granule cells for every 1 Purkinje cell. It is into this molecular layer that the dendrites of the Purkinje cells project and 80,000 to 200,000 of the parallel fibers synapse with each Purkinje cell.",
          "The mossy fiber input to the Purkinje cell is quite dif- ferent from the climbing fiber input because the synaptic connections are weak, so large numbers of mossy fibers must be stimulated simultaneously to excite the Purkinje cell. Furthermore, activation usually takes the form of a much weaker, short-duration Purkinje cell action poten- tial called a simple spike, rather than the prolonged com- plex action potential caused by climbing fiber input.",
          "Purkinje Cells and Deep Nuclear Cells Fire Continu- ously Under Normal Resting Conditions. One charac- teristic of both Purkinje cells and deep nuclear cells is that normally both of them fire continuously; the Purkinje cell fires at about 50 to 100 action potentials per second, and the deep nuclear cells fire at much higher rates. Further- more, the output activity of both these cells can be modu- lated upward or downward.",
          "Balance Between Excitation and Inhibition at the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei. Referring again to the circuit of Figure 57-7, note that direct stimulation of the deep nuclear cells by both the climbing and the mossy fibers ex- cites them. By contrast, signals arriving from the Purkinje cells inhibit them. Normally, the balance between these two effects is slightly in favor of excitation so that under quiet conditions, output from the deep nuclear cell re- mains relatively constant at a moderate level of continu- ous stimulation.",
          "In execution of a rapid motor movement, the initiat- ing signal from the cerebral motor cortex or brain stem at first greatly increases deep nuclear cell excitation. Then, another few milliseconds later, feedback inhibitory sig- nals from the Purkinje cell circuit arrive. In this way, there is first a rapid excitatory signal sent by the deep nuclear cells into the motor output pathway to enhance the motor movement, followed within another small fraction of a second by an inhibitory signal. This inhibitory signal resembles a “delay line” negative feedback signal of the type that is effective in providing damping. That is, when the motor system is excited, a negative feedback signal occurs after a short delay to stop the muscle movement from overshooting its mark. Otherwise, oscillation of the movement would occur.",
          "Basket Cells and Stellate Cells Cause Lateral Inhibi- tion of Purkinje Cells in the Cerebellum. In addition to the deep nuclear cells, granule cells, and Purkinje cells, two other types of neurons are located in the cerebel- lum—basket cells and stellate cells, which are inhibitory cells with short axons. Both the basket cells and the stel- late cells are located in the molecular layer of the cerebel- lar cortex, lying among and stimulated by the small par- allel fibers. These cells in turn send their axons at right angles across the parallel fibers and cause lateral inhibi- tion of adjacent Purkinje cells, thus sharpening the sig- nal in the same manner that lateral inhibition sharpens contrast of signals in many other neuronal circuits of the nervous system."

        "paragraphs": [
          "The typical function of the cerebellum is to help provide rapid turn-on signals for the agonist muscles and simulta- neous reciprocal turn-off signals for the antagonist mus- cles at the onset of a movement. Then, on approaching termination of the movement, the cerebellum is mainly responsible for timing and executing the turn-off signals to the agonists and the turn-on signals to the antagonists. Although the exact details are not fully known, one can speculate from the basic cerebellar circuit of Figure 57-7 how this process might work, as follows.",
          "Let us suppose that the turn-on/turn-off pattern of agonist/antagonist contraction at the onset of move- ment begins with signals from the cerebral cortex. These signals pass through noncerebellar brain stem and cord pathways directly to the agonist muscle to begin the initial contraction.",
          "At the same time, parallel signals are sent by way of the pontile mossy fibers into the cerebellum. One branch of each mossy fiber goes directly to deep nuclear cells in the dentate or other deep cerebellar nuclei, which instantly sends an excitatory signal back into the cerebral corticospinal motor system, either by way of return signals through the thalamus to the cere- bral cortex or by way of neuronal circuitry in the brain stem, to support the muscle contraction signal that had already been begun by the cerebral cortex. As a con- sequence, the turn-on signal, after a few milliseconds, becomes even more powerful than it was at the start because it becomes the sum of both the cortical and the cerebellar signals. This effect is the normal effect when the cerebellum is intact, but in the absence of the cerebellum, the secondary extra supportive signal is missing. This cerebellar support makes the turn-on muscle contraction much stronger than it would be if the cerebellum did not exist.",
          "Now, what causes the turn-off signal for the agonist muscles at the termination of the movement? Remem- ber that all mossy fibers have a second branch that transmits signals by way of the granule cells to the cer- ebellar cortex and, eventually, by way of “parallel” fibers, to the Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cells in turn inhibit the deep nuclear cells. This pathway passes through some of the smallest, slowest-conducting nerve fibers in the nervous system—that is, the parallel fibers of the cerebellar cortical molecular layer, which have diam- eters of only a fraction of a millimeter. Also, the sig- nals from these fibers are weak, so they require a finite period to build up enough excitation in the dendrites of the Purkinje cell to excite it. However, once the Pur- kinje cell is excited, it sends a strong inhibitory signal to the same deep nuclear cell that had originally turned on the movement. Therefore, this signal helps turn off the movement after a short time.",
          "Thus, one can see how the complete cerebellar circuit could cause a rapid turn-on agonist muscle contraction at the beginning of a movement and yet also cause a pre- cisely timed turn-off of the same agonist contraction after a given period.",
          "Now, let us speculate on the circuit for the antago- nist muscles. Most important, remember that there are reciprocal agonist-antagonist circuits throughout the spi- nal cord for virtually every movement that the cord can initiate. Therefore, these circuits are part of the basis for antagonist turn-off at the onset of movement and then turn-on at termination of movement, mirroring whatever occurs in the agonist muscles. But also remember that the cerebellum contains several other types of inhibitory cells besides Purkinje cells. The functions of some of these cells are still to be determined; they, too, could play roles in the initial inhibition of the antagonist muscles at onset of a movement and subsequent excitation at the end of a movement.",
          "These mechanisms are still partly speculation. They are presented here to illustrate ways by which the cerebel- lum could cause exaggerated turn-on and turn-off signals, thus controlling the agonist and antagonist muscles, as well as the timing."

        "paragraphs": [
          "The degree to which the cerebellum supports onset and offset of muscle contractions, as well as timing of con- tractions, must be learned by the cerebellum. Typically, when a person first performs a new motor act, the degree of motor enhancement by the cerebellum at the onset of contraction, the degree of inhibition at the end of contrac- tion, and the timing of these are almost always incorrect for precise movements. However, after the act has been performed many times, the individual events become progressively more precise, sometimes requiring only a few movements before the desired result is achieved, but at other times requiring hundreds of movements.",
          "How do these adjustments come about? The exact answer is not known, although it is known that sensitivity levels of cerebellar circuits progressively adapt during the training process, especially the sensitivity of the Purkinje cells to respond to the granule cell excitation. Further- more, this sensitivity change is brought about by signals from the climbing fibers entering the cerebellum from the inferior olivary complex.",
          "Under resting conditions, the climbing fibers fire about once per second, but they cause extreme depolarization of the entire dendritic tree of the Purkinje cell, lasting for up to 1 second, each time they fire. During this time, the Purkinje cell fires with one initial strong output spike, fol- lowed by a series of diminishing spikes. When a person performs a new movement for the first time, feedback sig- nals from the muscle and joint proprioceptors will usually denote to the cerebellum how much the actual movement fails to match the intended movement, and the climbing fiber signals alter the long-term sensitivity of the Purkinje cells in some way. Over a period, this change in sensitivity, along with other possible “learning” functions of the cer- ebellum, is believed to make the timing and other aspects of cerebellar control of movements approach perfection. When this state has been achieved, the climbing fibers no longer need to send “error” signals to the cerebellum to cause further change."

          "The nervous system uses the cerebellum to coordinate motor control functions at three levels: m 1. The vestibulocerebellum. This level consists princi- pally of the small flocculonodular cerebellar lobes that lie under the posterior cerebellum and adjacent portions of the vermis. It provides neural circuits for most of the body’s equilibrium movements. m 2. The spinocerebellum. This level consists of most of the vermis of the posterior and anterior cerebellum plus the adjacent intermediate zones on both sides of the vermis. It provides the circuitry for coordi- nating mainly movements of the distal portions of the limbs, especially the hands and fingers. m 3. The cerebrocerebellum. This level consists of the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, lateral to the intermediate zones. It receives virtu- ally all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of the cerebrum. It transmits its output information in the upward direction back to the brain, function- ing in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements. These movements are planned as much as tenths of a second in advance of the actual movements. This process is called de- velopment of “motor imagery” of movements to be performed."

        "paragraphs": [
          "The vestibulocerebellum originated phylogenetically at about the same time that the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear developed. Furthermore, as discussed in Chap- ter 56, loss of the flocculonodular lobes and adjacent por- tions of the vermis of the cerebellum, which constitute the vestibulocerebellum, causes extreme disturbance of equi- librium and postural movements.",
          "In people with vestibulocerebellar dysfunction, equi- librium is far more disturbed during performance of rapid motions than during inactivity, especially when these movements involve changes in direction of movement and stimulate the semicircular ducts. This phenomenon suggests that the vestibulocerebellum is important in con- trolling balance between agonist and antagonist muscle contractions of the spine, hips, and shoulders during rapid changes in body positions as required by the ves- tibular apparatus.",
          "One of the major problems in controlling balance is the amount of time required to transmit position sig- nals and velocity of movement signals from the differ- ent parts of the body to the brain. Even when the most rapidly conducting sensory pathways are used, up to 120 m/sec in the spinocerebellar afferent tracts, the delay for transmission from the feet to the brain is still 15 to 20 milliseconds. The feet of a person running rapidly can move as much as 10 inches during that time. Therefore, it is never possible for return signals from the peripheral parts of the body to reach the brain at the same time that the movements actually occur. How, then, is it possible for the brain to know when to stop a movement and to perform the next sequential act when the movements are performed rapidly? The answer is that the signals from the periphery tell the brain how rapidly and in which direc- tions the body parts are moving. It is then the function of the vestibulocerebellum to calculate in advance from these rates and directions where the different parts will be during the next few milliseconds. The results of these calculations are the key to the brain’s progression to the next sequential movement.",
          "Thus, during control of equilibrium, it is presumed that information from both the body periphery and the vestibular apparatus is used in a typical feedback con- trol circuit to provide anticipatory correction of postural motor signals necessary for maintaining equilibrium even during extremely rapid motion, including rapidly chang- ing directions of motion."

        "paragraphs": [

          "After the intermediate zone of the cerebellum has compared the intended movements with the actual move- ments, the deep nuclear cells of the interposed nucleus send corrective output signals (1) back to the cerebral motor cortex through relay nuclei in the thalamus and (2) to the magnocellular portion (the lower portion) of the red nucleus that gives rise to the rubrospinal tract. The rubrospinal tract in turn joins the corticospinal tract in innervating the lateralmost motor neurons in the ante- rior horns of the spinal cord gray matter, the neurons that control the distal parts of the limbs, particularly the hands and fingers.",
          "This part of the cerebellar motor control system pro- vides smooth, coordinated movements of the agonist and antagonist muscles of the distal limbs for performing acute purposeful patterned movements. The cerebellum seems to compare the “intentions” of the higher levels of the motor control system, as transmitted to the interme- diate cerebellar zone through the corticopontocerebellar tract, with the “performance” by the respective parts of the body, as transmitted back to the cerebellum from the periphery. In fact, the ventral spinocerebellar tract even transmits back to the cerebellum an “efference” copy of the actual motor control signals that reach the anterior motor neurons, and this information is also integrated with the signals arriving from the muscle spindles and other pro- prioceptor sensory organs, transmitted principally in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract. Similar comparator signals also go to the inferior olivary complex; if the signals do not compare favorably, the olivary—Purkinje cell system, along with possibly other cerebellar learning mecha- nisms, eventually corrects the motions until they perform the desired function.",
          "Function of the Cerebellum to Prevent Overshoot and to “Damp” Movements. Almost all movements of the body are “pendular” For example, when an arm is moved, momentum develops, and the momentum must be over- come before the movement can be stopped. Because of momentum, all pendular movements have a tendency to overshoot. If overshooting occurs in a person whose cer- ebellum has been destroyed, the conscious centers of the cerebrum eventually recognize this error and initiate a movement in the reverse direction to attempt to bring the arm to its intended position. However, the arm, by virtue of its momentum, overshoots once more in the opposite direction, and appropriate corrective signals must again be instituted. Thus, the arm oscillates back and forth past its intended point for several cycles before it finally fixes on its mark. This effect is called an action tremor or inten- tion tremor.",
          "If the cerebellum is intact, appropriate learned, sub- conscious signals stop the movement precisely at the intended point, thereby preventing the overshoot and the tremor. This activity is the basic characteristic of a damp- ing system. All control systems regulating pendular ele- ments that have inertia must have damping circuits built into the mechanisms. For motor control by the nervous system, the cerebellum provides most of this damping function.",
          "Cerebellar Control of Ballistic Movements. Most rapid movements of the body, such as the movements of the fingers in typing, occur so rapidly that it is not possible to receive feedback information either from the periphery to the cerebellum or from the cerebellum back to the mo- tor cortex before the movements are over. These move- ments are called ballistic movements, meaning that the entire movement is preplanned and set into motion to go a specific distance and then to stop. Another important example is the saccadic movements of the eyes, in which the eyes jump from one position to the next when read- ing or when looking at successive points along a road as a person is moving in a car.",
          "Three major changes occur in these ballistic move- ments when the cerebellum is removed: (1) the move- ments are slow to develop and do not have the extra onset surge that the cerebellum usually provides; (2) the force developed is weak; and (3) the movements are slow to turn off, usually allowing the movement to go well beyond the intended mark. Therefore, in the absence of the cer- ebellar circuit, the motor cortex has to think extra hard to turn ballistic movements on and off. Thus, the automa- tism of ballistic movements is lost.",
          "Considering once again the circuitry of the cerebellum, one sees that it is beautifully organized to perform this biphasic, first excitatory and then delayed inhibitory func- tion that is required for preplanned rapid ballistic move- ments. Also, the built-in timing circuits of the cerebellar cortex are fundamental to this particular ability of the cerebellum."

This characteristic goes along with human abilities to plan and perform intricate sequential patterns of movement, espe- cially with the hands and fingers, and to speak. Yet, the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres have no direct input of information from the peripheral parts of the body. In addition, almost all communication between these lateral cerebellar areas and the cerebral cortex is not with the primary cerebral motor cortex but instead with the premotor area and primary and association somato- sensory areas.",
          "Even so, destruction of the lateral zones of the cerebel- lar hemispheres, along with their deep nuclei, the dentate nuclei, can lead to extreme incoordination of complex purposeful movements of the hands, fingers, and feet and of the speech apparatus. This condition has been difficult to understand because there is no direct communication between this part of the cerebellum and the primary motor cortex. However, experimental studies suggest that these portions of the cerebellum are concerned with two other important but indirect aspects of motor control: (1) planning of sequential movements and (2) “timing” of the sequential movements.",
          "Planning of Sequential Movements. The planning of sequential movements requires that the lateral zones of the hemispheres communicate with both the premotor and sensory portions of the cerebral cortex, and it re- quires two-way communication between these cerebral cortex areas with corresponding areas of the basal ganglia. It seems that the “plan” of sequential movements actually begins in the sensory and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex, and from there the plan is transmitted to the later- al zones of the cerebellar hemispheres. Then, amid much two-way traffic between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, appropriate motor signals provide transition from one sequence of movements to the next.",
          "An interesting observation that supports this view is that many neurons in the cerebellar dentate nuclei display the activity pattern for the sequential movement that is yet to come while the present movement is still occurring. Thus, the lateral cerebellar zones appear to be involved not with what movement is happening at a given moment but with what will be happening during the next sequential move- ment a fraction of a second or perhaps even seconds later.",
          "To summarize, one of the most important features of normal motor function is one’s ability to progress smoothly from one movement to the next in orderly suc- cession. In the absence of the large lateral zones of the cer- ebellar hemispheres, this capability is seriously disturbed for rapid movements.",
          "Timing Function for Sequential Movements. Another important function of the lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres is to provide appropriate timing for each succeeding movement. In the absence of these cerebellar zones, one loses the subconscious ability to predict how far the different parts of the body will move in a given time. Without this timing capability, the person becomes unable to determine when the next sequential movement needs to begin. As a result, the succeeding movement may begin too early or, more likely, too late. Therefore, le- sions in the lateral zones of the cerebellum cause complex movements (e.g., those required for writing, running, or even talking) to become incoordinate and lacking ability to progress in orderly sequence from one movement to the next. Such cerebellar lesions are said to cause failure of smooth progression of movements.",
          "Extramotor Predictive Functions of the Cerebrocer- ebellum. The cerebrocerebellum (the large lateral lobes) also helps to “time” events other than movements of the body. For example, the rates of progression of both audi- tory and visual phenomena can be predicted by the brain, but both of these require cerebellar participation. As an example, a person can predict from the changing visual scene how rapidly he or she is approaching an object. A striking experiment that demonstrates the importance of the cerebellum in this ability is the effects of removing the large lateral portions of the cerebellum in monkeys. Such a monkey occasionally charges into the wall of a corridor because it is unable to predict when it will reach the wall.",

          "One of the principal roles of the basal ganglia in motor control is to function in association with the corticospinal system to control complex patterns of motor activity, An example is the writing of letters of the alphabet. When the basal ganglia sustain serious damage, the cortical sys- tem of motor control can no longer provide these pat- terns. Instead, one’s writing becomes crude, as if one were earning how to write for the first time.",
          "Other patterns that require the basal ganglia are cut- ting paper with scissors, hammering nails, shooting a basketball through a hoop, passing a football, throwing a baseball, the movements of shoveling dirt, most aspects of vocalization, controlled movements of the eyes, and vir- tually any other of our skilled movements, most of them performed subconsciously.",
          "Neural Pathways of the Putamen Circuit. Figure 57- 11 shows the principal pathways through the basal gan- glia for executing learned patterns of movement. They begin mainly in the premotor and supplementary areas of the motor cortex and in the somatosensory areas of the sensory cortex. Next they pass to the putamen (mainly bypassing the caudate nucleus), then to the internal por- tion of the globus pallidus, and next to the ventroanterior and ventrolateral relay nuclei of the thalamus, and they finally return to the cerebral primary motor cortex and to portions of the premotor and supplementary cerebral areas closely associated with the primary motor cortex. Thus, the putamen circuit has its inputs mainly from the parts of the brain adjacent to the primary motor cortex but not much from the primary motor cortex itself. Then its outputs do go mainly back to the primary motor cortex or closely associated premotor and supplementary cor- tex. Functioning in close association with this primary putamen circuit are ancillary circuits that pass from the putamen through the external globus pallidus, the sub- thalamus, and the substantia nigra—finally returning to the motor cortex by way of the thalamus.",
          "Abnormal Function in the Putamen Circuit: Athetosis, Hemiballismus, and Chorea. How does the putamen cir- cuit function to help execute patterns of movement? Little is known about this function. However, when a portion of the circuit is damaged or blocked, certain patterns of move- ment become severely abnormal. For example, lesions in the globus pallidus frequently lead to spontaneous and of- ten continuous writhing movements of a hand, an arm, the neck, or the face. These movements are called athetosis.",
          "A lesion in the subthalamus often leads to sudden flailing movements of an entire limb, a condition called hemiballismus.",

        "paragraphs": [
          "The term cognition means the thinking processes of the brain, using both sensory input to the brain plus informa- tion already stored in memory. Most of our motor actions occur as a consequence of thoughts generated in the mind, a process called cognitive control of motor activity. The caudate nucleus plays a major role in this cognitive control of motor activity.",
          "The neural connections between the caudate nucleus and the corticospinal motor control system, shown in Fig- ure 57-12, are somewhat different from those of the puta- men circuit. Part of the reason for this difference is that the caudate nucleus, as shown in Figure 57-9, extends into all lobes of the cerebrum, beginning anteriorly in the frontal lobes, then passing posteriorly through the pari- etal and occipital lobes, and finally curving forward again like the letter “C” into the temporal lobes. Furthermore, the caudate nucleus receives large amounts of its input from the association areas of the cerebral cortex overlying the caudate nucleus, mainly areas that also integrate the different types of sensory and motor information into usable thought patterns.",
          "After the signals pass from the cerebral cortex to the caudate nucleus, they are transmitted to the inter- nal globus pallidus, then to the relay nuclei of the ventroanterior and ventrolateral thalamus, and finally back to the prefrontal, premotor, and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex, but with almost none of the returning signals passing directly to the primary motor cortex. Instead, the returning signals go to the accessory motor regions in the premotor and supplementary motor areas that are concerned with building sequential patterns of movement lasting 5 seconds or more instead of exciting individual muscle movements.",
          "A good example of this phenomenon would be a person seeing a lion approach and then respond- ing instantaneously and automatically by (1) turning away from the lion, (2) beginning to run, and (3) even attempting to climb a tree. Without the cognitive func- tions, the person might not have the instinctive knowl- edge, without thinking for too long a time, to respond quickly and appropriately. Thus, cognitive control of motor activity determines subconsciously, and within seconds, which patterns of movement will be used together to achieve a complex goal that might itself last for many seconds."

        "topic": "FUNCTION OF THE BASAL GANGLIA TO CHANGE THE TIMING AND TO SCALE THE INTENSITY OF MOVEMENTS",
        "paragraphs": [
          "Two important capabilities of the brain in controlling movement are to (1) determine how rapidly the move- ment is to be performed and (2) control how large the movement will be. For example, a person may write the letter “a” slowly or rapidly. Also, he or she may write a small “a” on a piece of paper or a large “A” on a chalk- board. Regardless of the choice, the proportional char- acteristics of the letter remain nearly the same.",
          "In patients with severe lesions of the basal ganglia, these timing and scaling functions are poor—in fact, sometimes they are nonexistent. Here again, the basal ganglia do not function alone; rather, they function in close association with the cerebral cortex. One especially important corti- cal area is the posterior parietal cortex, which is the locus of the spatial coordinates for motor control of all parts of the body, as well as for the relationship of the body and its parts to all its surroundings. Damage to this area does not produce simple deficits of sensory perception, such as loss of tactile sensation, blindness, or deafness. Instead, lesions of the posterior parietal cortex produce an inabil- ity to perceive objects accurately through normally func- tioning sensory mechanisms, a condition called agnosia. Figure 57-13 shows how a person with a lesion in the right posterior parietal cortex might try to copy drawings. In these cases, the patient’s ability to copy the left side of the drawings is severely impaired. Also, such a person will always try to avoid using his or her left arm, left hand, or other portions of his or her left body for the performance of tasks; the person may not even wash this side of the body (personal neglect syndrome), almost not knowing that these parts of the body exist.",

          "Figure 57-13 Illustration of drawings that might be made by a per- son who has neglect syndrome caused by severe damage in his or her right posterior parietal cortex compared with the actual drawing the patient was requested to copy. Note that the person’s ability to copy the left side of the drawings is severely impaired.",
          "Because the caudate circuit of the basal ganglial system functions mainly with association areas of the cerebral cortex, such as the posterior parietal cortex, presumably the timing and scaling of movements are functions of this caudate cognitive motor control circuit. However, our understanding of basal ganglia function is still so imprecise that much of what is discussed in the last few sections is analytical deduction rather than proven fact."

          "Figure 57-14 demonstrates the interplay of several spe- cific neurotransmitters that are known to function in the basal ganglia, showing the following: (1) dopamine path- ways from the substantia nigra to the caudate nucleus and putamen; (2) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) path- ways from the caudate nucleus and putamen to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; (3) acetylcholine pathways from the cortex to the caudate nucleus and putamen; and (4) multiple general pathways from the brain stem that secrete norepinephrine, serotonin, enkephalin, and several other neurotransmitters in the basal ganglia, as well as in other parts of the cerebrum. In addition to all these are multiple glutamate pathways that provide most of the excitatory signals (not shown in the figure) that balance out the large numbers of inhibitory signals transmitted especially by the dopamine, GABA, and serotonin inhibi- tory transmitters. We have more to say about some of these neurotransmitter and hormonal systems in subse- quent sections when we discuss diseases of the basal gan- glia, as well as in subsequent chapters when we discuss behavior, sleep, wakefulness, and functions of the auto- nomic nervous system.",
          "For the present, it should be remembered that GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Therefore, GABA neurons in the feedback loops from the cortex through the basal ganglia and then back to the cortex make virtually all these loops negative feedback loops, rather than positive feedback loops, thus lending stability to the motor control systems. Dopamine also functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in most parts of the brain, so it also functions as a stabilizer under some conditions."

          "Parkinson's disease, which is also known as paralysis agi- tans, results from widespread degeneration of the por- tion of the substantia nigra (the pars compacta) that sends dopamine-secreting nerve fibers to the caudate nucleus and putamen. The disease is characterized by the follow- ing: (1) rigidity of much of the musculature of the body; (2) involuntary tremor at a fixed rate of 3 to 6 cycles/sec of the involved areas, even when the person is resting; (3) serious difficulty in initiating movement, called akinesia; (4) pos- tural instability caused by impaired postural reflexes, lead- ing to poor balance and falls; and (5) other motor symp- toms, including dysphagia (impaired ability to swallow), speech disorders, gait disturbances, and fatigue",
          "The causes of these abnormal motor effects are not fully understood. However, the dopamine secreted in the caudate nucleus and putamen is an inhibitory transmit- ter; therefore, destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra theoretically would allow the cau- date nucleus and putamen to become overly active and possibly cause continuous output of excitatory signals to the corticospinal motor control system. These signals could overly excite many or all of the muscles of the body, thus leading to rigidity in patients with Parkinson's dis- ease.",
          "Some of the feedback circuits might easily oscillate be- cause of high feedback gains after loss of their inhibition, leading to the tremor of Parkinson's disease. This tremor is quite different from that of cerebellar disease because it occurs during all waking hours and therefore is an invol- untary tremor, in contradistinction to cerebellar tremor, which occurs only when the person performs intentionally initiated movements.",
          "The akinesia that occurs in Parkinson's disease is often much more distressing to the patient than are the symp- toms of muscle rigidity and tremor, because a person with severe Parkinson's disease must exert the highest degree of concentration to perform even the simplest movement. The mental effort, even mental anguish, that is necessary to make the desired movements is often at the limit of the patient's willpower. Then, when the movements do occur, they are usually stiff and staccato in character instead of smooth. The cause of this akinesia is still speculative. How- ever, dopamine secretion in the limbic system, especially in the nucleus accumbens, is often decreased, along with its decrease in the basal ganglia. It has been suggested that this decrease might reduce the psychic drive for motor activity so greatly that akinesia results.",
          "Nonmotor features of Parkinson's disease include sleep disturbances, depression and anxiety, autonomic dysfunc- tion, and cognitive impairment in advanced stages.",
          "Treatment With t-Dopa. Administration of the drug L- dopa to patients with Parkinson's disease usually amelio- rates many of the motor disturbances, especially the rigid- ity and akinesia, but has little beneficial effect on nonmotor symptoms. The reason for the amelioration of motor disor- ders is believed to be that L-dopa is converted in the brain into dopamine, and the dopamine then restores the normal balance between inhibition and excitation in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Administration of dopamine does not have the same effect because dopamine has a chemical structure that will not allow it to pass through the blood— brain barrier; the slightly different structure of L-dopa al- lows it to pass through this barrier.",
          "Treatment With Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. An- other treatment for Parkinson’s disease includes drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase, which is responsible for destruction of most of the dopamine after it has been secreted. Therefore, any dopamine that is released remains in the basal ganglial tissues for a longer time. In addition, for reasons that are not understood, this treatment helps to slow destruction of the dopamine-secreting neurons in the substantia nigra. Therefore, appropriate combinations of L-dopa therapy along with monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy usually provide much better treatment than use of one of these drugs alone.",
          "Treatment With Transplanted Fetal Dopamine Cells. Transplantation of fetal dopamine-secreting brain cells into the caudate nuclei and putamen has been used with some short-term success to treat Parkinson’s disease. If per- sistence could be achieved, perhaps this treatment would become the treatment of the future."

In addition, severe dementia develops along with the motor dysfunctions.",
          "The abnormal movements of Huntington's disease are believed to be caused by the loss of most of the cell bodies of the GABA-secreting neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen and the loss of acetylcholine-secreting neurons in many parts of the brain. The axon terminals of the GABA neurons normally inhibit portions of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. This loss of inhibition is believed to allow spontaneous outbursts of globus pallidus and sub- stantia nigra activity that cause the distortional move- ments.",

When needed, the corticospi- nal system can bypass the cord patterns, replacing them with higher level patterns from the brain stem or cerebral cortex.

It functions with the spinal cord especially to enhance the stretch reflex, so when a contracting muscle encounters an unexpectedly heavy load, a long stretch reflex signal transmitted all the way through the cerebellum and back again to the cord strongly enhances the load-resisting ef- fect of the basic stretch reflex.",

Near the end of each movement, the cer- ebellum turns on antagonist muscles at exactly the right time and with proper force to stop the movement at the intended point. Furthermore, almost all aspects of this turn-on/turn-off patterning by the cerebellum can be learned with experience.",
          "The cerebellum functions with the cerebral cortex at still another level of motor control; it helps to program in advance muscle contractions that are required for smooth progression from a present rapid movement in one direc- tion to the next rapid movement in another direction, with all this occurring in a fraction of a second. The neural circuit for this passes from the cerebral cortex to the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres and then back to the cerebral cortex.",

In its ab- sence, a person can still have excellent language compre- hension through hearing but not through reading; injury to the angular gyrus can result in agraphia (inability to write) with alexia (inability to read), a condition in which a person cannot read, write, or spell words.",
          "Area for Naming Objects. Jn the most lateral portions of the anterior occipital lobe and posterior temporal lobe is an area for naming objects. The names are learned mainly through auditory input, whereas the physical natures of the objects are learned mainly through visual input. In turn, the names are essential for both auditory and visual lan- guage comprehension (functions performed in Wernicke's area located immediately superior to the auditory “names” region and anterior to the visual word processing area).",
          "Prefrontal Association Area",
          "As discussed in Chapter 57, the prefrontal association area functions in close association with the motor cortex to plan complex patterns and sequences of motor move- ments. To aid in this function, it receives strong input through a massive subcortical bundle of nerve fibers con- necting the parieto-occipitotemporal association area with the prefrontal association area. Through this bundle, the prefrontal cortex receives much preanalyzed sensory information, especially information on the spatial coordi- nates of the body that is necessary for planning effective movements. Much of the output from the prefrontal area into the motor control system passes through the caudate portion of the basal ganglia—thalamic feedback circuit for motor planning, which provides many of the sequential and parallel components of movement stimulation.",
          "The prefrontal association area is also essential to car- rying out “thought” processes. This characteristic presum- ably results from some of the same capabilities of the prefrontal cortex that allow it to plan motor activities. It seems to be capable of processing nonmotor and motor information from widespread areas of the brain and therefore to achieve nonmotor types of thinking, as well as motor types. In fact, the prefrontal association area is frequently described simply as important for elabora- tion of thoughts, and it is said to store on a short-term basis “working memories” that are used to combine new thoughts while they are entering the brain.",
          "Broca’s Area Provides the Neural Circuitry for Word Formation. Broca’s area, shown in Figure 58-5, is located partly in the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex and partly in the premotor area. It is here that plans and motor patterns for expressing individual words or even short phras- es are initiated and executed. This area also works in close association with the Wernicke language comprehension center in the temporal association cortex, as we discuss more fully later in the chapter.",
          "An especially interesting discovery is the following: When a person has already learned one language and then learns a new language, the area in the brain where the new language is stored is slightly removed from the storage area for the first language. If both languages are learned simultaneously, they are stored together in the same area of the brain."

We discuss in Chapter 59 that the limbic cortex is part of a much more extensive system, the limbic system, that includes a complex set of neuronal structures in the midbasal regions of the brain.

This area of confluence of the different sensory inter- pretative areas is especially highly developed in the dominant side of the brain—the /eft side in almost all right-handed people—and it plays the greatest single role of any part of the cerebral cortex for the higher comprehension levels of brain function that we call intelligence. Therefore, this region has been called by dif- ferent names suggestive of an area that has almost global importance: the general interpretative area, the gnostic area, the knowing area, the tertiary association area, and so forth. It is best known as Wernicke’s area in honor of the neurologist who first described its special signifi- cance in intellectual processes.",

The types of thoughts that might be experienced include complicated visual scenes that one might remember from childhood, auditory hallucinations such as a specific musical piece, or even a statement made by a specific person. For this reason, it is believed that activation of Wernicke’s area can call forth complicated memory patterns that involve more than one sensory modality even though most of the indi- vidual memories may be stored elsewhere. This belief is in accord with the importance of Wernicke’s area in inter- preting the complicated meanings of different patterns of sensory experiences.",

If this region is destroyed while Wer- nicke’s area in the temporal lobe is still intact, the person can still interpret auditory experiences as usual, but the stream of visual experiences passing into Wernicke’s area from the visual cortex is mainly blocked. Therefore, the person may be able to see words and even know that they are words but may not be able to interpret their mean- ings. This condition is called alexia, or word blindness.

However, if for some reason this left side area is dam- aged or removed in very early childhood, the opposite side of the brain will usually develop dominant characteristics.",
          "The following theory can explain the capability of one hemisphere to dominate the other hemisphere. The atten- tion of the “mind” seems to be directed to one principal thought at a time. Presumably, because the left posterior temporal lobe at birth is usually slightly larger than the right lobe, the left side normally begins to be used to a greater extent than is the right side. Thereafter, because of the tendency to direct one’s attention to the better devel- oped region, the rate of learning in the cerebral hemi- sphere that gains the first start increases rapidly, whereas in the opposite, less used side, learning remains less well developed. Therefore, the left side normally becomes dominant over the right side.",
          "In about 95% of all people, the left temporal lobe and angular gyrus become dominant, and in the remaining 5%, either both sides develop simultaneously to have dual function or, more rarely, the right side alone becomes highly developed, with full dominance.",

This close relation probably results from the fact that the first introduction to language is by way of hearing. Later in life, when visual perception of language through the medium of reading develops, the visual information conveyed by written words is then presumably channeled through the angular gyrus, a visual association area, into the already developed Wernicke’s language interpretative area of the dominant temporal lobe."

Yet efforts to show that the prefrontal cortex is more important in higher intel- lectual functions than other portions of the brain have not been successful. Indeed, destruction of the language comprehension area in the posterior superior temporal lobe (Wernicke’s area) and the adjacent angular gyrus region in the dominant hemisphere causes much more harm to the intellect than does destruction of the pre- frontal areas.",

Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex may have normal motor functions and may even perform normally on some intelligence tests. However, they are unable to function effectively in normal daily life. These functions can be explained by describing what happens to patients in whom the prefrontal areas have become damaged, as follows.",
          "Several decades ago, before the advent of modern drugs for treating psychiatric conditions, it was discovered that some patients could receive significant relief from severe psychotic depression by severing the neuronal connec- tions between the prefrontal areas of the brain and the remainder of the brain by a procedure called prefrontal lobotomy. This procedure was performed by inserting a blunt, thin-bladed knife through a small opening in the lateral frontal skull on each side of the head and slicing the brain at the back edge of the prefrontal lobes from top to bottom. Subsequent studies in these patients showed the following mental changes: m 1. The patients lost their ability to solve complex prob- lems. m 2. They became unable to string together sequential tasks to reach complex goals. m 3. They became unable to learn to do several parallel tasks at the same time. m 4. Their level of aggressiveness decreased, sometimes markedly, and they often lost ambition. m 5. Their social responses were often inappropriate for the occasion, often including loss of morals and little reticence in relation to sexual activity and excre- tion. m 6. The patients could still talk and comprehend lan- guage, but they were unable to carry through any long trains of thought, and their moods changed rapidly from sweetness to rage to exhilaration to madness. m 7. The patients could also still perform most of the usual patterns of motor function that they had per- formed throughout life, but often without purpose. m From this information, let us try to piece together a coherent understanding of the function of the prefrontal association areas.",

Decreased aggressiveness and inappropriate social responses probably result from loss of the ventral parts of the frontal lobes on the underside of the brain. As explained earlier and as shown in Figures 58-4 and 58-5, this area is part of the limbic association cortex rather than of the prefrontal association cortex. This limbic area helps to control behavior, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 59.",

Psychological tests have shown that prefrontal lobectomized lower animals presented with successive bits of sensory information fail to keep track of these bits even in temporary memory, probably because they are distracted so easily that they cannot hold thoughts long enough for memory storage to take place.",
          "This ability of the prefrontal areas to keep track of many bits of information simultaneously and to cause recall of this information instantaneously as it is needed for sub- sequent thoughts is called the “brain's working memory,’ which may explain the many functions of the brain that we associate with higher intelligence. In fact, studies have shown that the prefrontal areas are divided into separate segments for storing different types of temporary memory, such as one area for storing shape and form of an object or a part of the body and another for storing movement.",

          "One of the functions of the corpus callosum and the anterior commissure is to make information stored in the cortex of one hemisphere available to corresponding cortical areas of the opposite hemisphere. The following important examples illustrate such cooperation between the two hemispheres. m 1. Cutting the corpus callosum blocks transfer of in- formation from Wernicke’s area of the dominant hemisphere to the motor cortex on the opposite side of the brain. Therefore, the intellectual functions of Wernicke’s area, located in the left hemisphere, lose control over the right motor cortex that initiates voluntary motor functions of the left hand and arm, even though the usual subconscious movements of the left hand and arm are normal. m 2. Cutting the corpus callosum prevents transfer of somatic and visual information from the right hem- isphere into Wernicke’s area in the left dominant hemisphere. Therefore, somatic and visual informa- tion from the left side of the body frequently fails to reach this general interpretative area of the brain and thus cannot be used for decision making. m 3. Finally, people whose corpus callosum is completely sectioned have two separate conscious portions of the brain. For example, in a teenage boy with a sec- tioned corpus callosum, only the left half of his brain could understand both the written word and the spoken word because the left side was the dominant hemisphere. Conversely, the right side of the brain could understand the written word but not the spo- ken word. Furthermore, the right cortex could elicit a motor action response to the written word with- out the left cortex ever knowing why the response was performed. The effect was quite different when an emotional response was evoked in the right side of the brain: in this case, a subconscious emotional response occurred in the left side of the brain as well. This response undoubtedly occurred because the areas of the two sides of the brain for emotions, the anterior temporal cortices and adjacent areas, were still communicating with each other through the anterior commissure that was not sectioned. For example, when the command “kiss” was written for the right half of his brain to see, the boy imme- diately and with full emotion said, “No way!” This response required function of Wernicke’s area and the motor areas for speech in the left hemisphere because these left-sided areas were necessary to speak the words “No way!” When asked why he said this, however, the boy could not explain it.",
          "Thus, the two halves of the brain have independent capabilities for consciousness, memory storage, com- munication, and control of motor activities. The corpus callosum is required for the two sides to operate coop- eratively at the superficial subconscious level, and the anterior commissure plays an important additional role in unifying the emotional responses of the two sides of the brain."

Conversely, a type of thought pattern that does require large involve- ment of the cerebral cortex is that of vision, because loss of the visual cortex causes complete inability to perceive visual form or color.",
          "We might formulate a provisional definition of a thought in terms of neural activity as follows. A thought results from a “pattern” of stimulation of many parts of the nervous system at the same time, probably involving most importantly the cerebral cortex, thalamus, limbic system, and upper reticular formation of the brain stem. This theory is called the holistic theory of thoughts and, in simplistic terms, means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The stimulated areas of the limbic system, thalamus, and reticular formation are believed to determine the general nature of the thought, giving it such qualities as pleasure, displeasure, pain, comfort, crude modalities of sensation, localization to gross areas of the body, and other general characteristics. However, specific stimulated areas of the cerebral cortex determine discrete characteristics of the thought, such as (1) specific local- ization of sensations on the surface of the body and of objects in the fields of vision, (2) the feeling of the texture of silk, (3) visual recognition of the rectangular pattern of a concrete block wall, and (4) other individual character- istics that enter into one’s overall awareness of a particular instant.

For the purpose of discussing these types of memories, we can use a common classification that divides memories into the following: (1) short-term memory, which includes memories that last for seconds or at most minutes un- less they are converted into longer-term memories; (2) intermediate long-term memories, which last for days to weeks but then fade away; and (3) long-term mem- ory, which, once stored, can be recalled up to years or even a lifetime later.",
          "In addition to this general classification of memories, we also discussed earlier (in connection with the pre- frontal lobes) another type of memory, called “working memory,’ which includes mainly short-term memory that is used during the course of intellectual reason- ing but is terminated as each stage of the problem is resolved.",
          "Memories are frequently classified according to the type of information that is stored. One of these classifica- tions divides memory into declarative memory and skill memory, as follows: m 1. Declarative memory basically means memory of the various details of an integrated thought, such as memory of an important experience that includes memory of the following: (1) the surroundings; (2) time relationships, (3) causes of the experience; (4) meaning of the experience; and (5) the deductions that were left in the person's mind. m 2. Skill memory is frequently associated with mo- tor activities of the person's body, such as all the skills developed for hitting a tennis ball, includ- ing automatic memories to (1) sight the ball, (2) calculate the relationship and speed of the ball to the racquet, and (3) deduce rapidly the motions of the body, the arms, and the racquet required to hit the ball as desired—with all of these skills activated instantly based on previous learning of thegame—and then moving on to the next stroke of the game while forgetting the details of the previ- ous stroke."

          "Many physiologists have suggested that this short-term memory is caused by continual neural activity resulting from nerve signals that travel around and around a temporary memory trace in a circuit of reverberating neurons. It has not yet been possible to prove this theory. Another possible explanation of short-term memory is presynaptic facilitation or inhibition, which occurs at synapses that lie on terminal nerve fibrils immediately before these fibrils synapse with a subsequent neuron. The neurotransmitter chemicals secreted at such terminals frequently cause facil- itation or inhibition lasting for seconds up to several min- utes. Circuits of this type could lead to short-term memory."

Experiments in animals have demonstrated that memories of the intermediate long-term type can result from temporary chemical or physical changes, or both, in either the synapse presynaptic terminals or the synapse postsynaptic membrane, changes that can persist for a few minutes up to several weeks. These mechanisms are so important that they deserve special description."

          "Figure 58-9 shows a mechanism of memory studied especially by Eric Kandel and his colleagues that can cause memories lasting from a few minutes up to 3 weeks in the large snail Aplysia. In Figure 58-9, there are two synaptic terminals. One terminal, which is from a sensory input neuron, terminates directly on the surface of the neuron that is to be stimulated and is called the sensory termi- nal. The other terminal, a presynaptic ending that lies on the surface of the sensory terminal, is called the facilita- tor terminal. When the sensory terminal is stimulated repeatedly but without stimulation of the facilitator ter- minal, signal transmission at first is great, but it becomes less and less intense with repeated stimulation until trans- mission almost ceases. This phenomenon is habituation, as was explained previously. It is a type of negative mem- ory that causes the neuronal circuit to lose its response to repeated events that are insignificant.",
          "Conversely, if a noxious stimulus excites the facilita- tor terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulated, instead of the transmitted signal into the postsynaptic neuron becoming progressively weaker, the ease of transmission becomes stronger and stronger. It will remain strong for minutes, hours, days, or, with more intense training, up to about 3 weeks even without further stimulation of the facilitator terminal. Thus, the noxious stimulus causes the memory pathway through the sensory terminal to become facilitated for days or weeks thereafter. It is especially interesting that even after habituation has occurred, this pathway can be converted back to a facilitated pathway with only a few noxious stimuli."

          "Mechanism for Habituation. At the molecular level, the habituation effect in the sensory terminal results from progressive closure of calcium channels through the terminal membrane, although the cause of this calcium channel closure is not fully known. Nevertheless, much smaller than normal amounts of calcium ions can diffuse into the habituated terminal, and much less sensory ter- minal transmitter is therefore released because calcium entry is the principal stimulus for transmitter release (as was discussed in Chapter 46).",
          "Mechanism for Facilitation. In the case of facilitation, at least part of the molecular mechanism is believed to be the following: m 1. Stimulation of the facilitator presynaptic terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulat- ed causes serotonin release at the facilitator synapse on the surface of the sensory terminal. m 2. The serotonin acts on serotonin receptors in the sensory terminal membrane, and these receptors activate the enzyme adenyl cyclase inside the mem- brane. The adenyl cyclase then causes formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), also in- side the sensory presynaptic terminal. m 3. The cAMP activates a protein kinase that causes phosphorylation of a protein that is part of the po- tassium channels in the sensory synaptic terminal membrane; this in turn blocks the channels for potassium conductance. The blockage can last for minutes up to several weeks. m 4. Lack of potassium conductance causes a greatly prolonged action potential in the synaptic terminal because flow of potassium ions out of the terminal is necessary for rapid recovery from the action po- tential. m 5. The prolonged action potential causes prolonged activation of the calcium channels, allowing tre- mendous quantities of calcium ions to enter the sensory synaptic terminal. These calcium ions cause greatly increased transmitter release by the synapse, thereby markedly facilitating synaptic transmission to the subsequent neuron.",
          "Thus, in a very indirect way, the associative effect of stimulating the facilitator terminal at the same time that the sensory terminal is stimulated causes prolonged increase in excitatory sensitivity of the sensory terminal, which establishes the memory trace.",
          "Additional studies in the snail Aplysia have suggested still another mechanism of synaptic memory. These stud- ies have shown that stimuli from separate sources acting on a single neuron, under appropriate conditions, can cause long-term changes in membrane properties of the postsynaptic neuron instead of in the presynaptic neuro- nal membrane, but leading to essentially the same mem- ory effects."

The structural changes will not occur if a drug is given that blocks protein synthesis in the presynaptic neuron, nor will the permanent memory trace develop. Therefore, it appears that development of true long-term memory depends on physically restruc- turing the synapses in a way that changes their sensitivity for transmitting nervous signals. The following important structural changes occur: 1. An increase in vesicle release sites for secretion of transmitter substance 2. An increase in the number of transmitter vesicles released 3. An increase in the number of presynaptic terminals 4. Changes in structures of the dendritic spines that permit transmission of stronger signals Thus, in several different ways, the structural capability of synapses to transmit signals appears to increase during establishment of true long-term memory traces."

If the new axons fail to connect with appropriate neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells, the new axons will degenerate within a few weeks. Thus, the number of neuronal con- nections is determined by specific nerve growth factors released retrogradely from the stimulated cells. Further- more, when insufficient connectivity occurs, the entire neuron that is sending out the axon branches might even- tually disappear.",
          "Therefore, soon after birth, the principle of “use it or lose it” governs the final number of neurons and their connectivities in respective parts of the human nervous system. This is a type of learning. For example, if one eye of a newborn animal is covered for many weeks after birth, neurons in alternate stripes of the cerebral visual cortex—neurons normally connected to the covered eye—will degenerate, and the covered eye will remain either partially or totally blind for the remainder of life. Until recently, it was believed that very little “learning” is achieved in adult human beings and animals by modi- fication of numbers of neurons in the memory circuits; however, recent research suggests that even adults use this mechanism at least to some extent."

This process requires 5 to 10 minutes for minimal consolidation and 1 hour or more for strong consolidation which requires synthesis of messenger RNA and proteins in the neurons. For exam- ple, if a strong sensory impression is made on the brain but is then followed within a minute or so by an electri- cally induced brain convulsion, the sensory experience will not be remembered. Likewise, brain concussion, sud- den application of deep general anesthesia, or any other effect that temporarily blocks the dynamic function of the brain can prevent consolidation.",
          "Consolidation and the time required for it to occur can probably be explained by the phenomenon of rehearsal of the short-term memory, as described in the following section.",
          "Rehearsal Enhances the Transference of Short-Term Memory Into Long-Term Memory. Studies have shown that rehearsal of the same information again and again in the mind accelerates and potentiates the degree of trans- fer of short-term memory into long-term memory and therefore accelerates and enhances consolidation. The brain has a natural tendency to rehearse newfound infor- mation, especially newfound information that catches the mind's attention. Therefore, over a period of time, the im- portant features of sensory experiences become progres- sively more and more fixed in the memory stores. This phenomenon explains why a person can remember small amounts of information studied in depth far better than large amounts of information studied only superficially. It also explains why a person who is wide awake can consoli- date memories far better than a person who is in a state of mental fatigue.",
          "New Memories Are Codified During Consolidation. One of the most important features of consolidation is that new memories are codified into different classes of information. During this process, similar types of infor- mation are pulled from the memory storage bins and used to help process the new information. The new and old are compared for similarities and differences, and part of the storage process is to store the information about these similarities and differences, rather than to store the new information unprocessed. Thus, during consolidation, the new memories are not stored randomly in the brain but are stored in direct association with other memories of the same type. This process is necessary for one to be able to “search” the memory store at a later date to find the required information."

The hippocampus is the most medial portion of the temporal lobe cortex, where it folds first medially underneath the brain and then upward into the lower, in- side surface of the lateral ventricle. The two hippocampi have been removed for the treatment of epilepsy in a few patients. This procedure does not seriously affect the per- son’s memory for information stored in the brain before removal of the hippocampi. However, after removal, these people have virtually no capability thereafter for storing verbal and symbolic types of memories (declarative types of memory) in long-term memory or even in intermedi- ate memory lasting longer than a few minutes. Therefore, these people are unable to create new long-term memo- ries of those types of information that are the basis of in- telligence. This condition is called anterograde amnesia.",
          "But why are the hippocampi so important in helping the brain to store new memories? The probable answer is that the hippocampi are among the most important out- put pathways from the “reward” and “punishment” areas of the limbic system, as explained in Chapter 59. Sensory stimuli or thoughts that cause pain or aversion excite the limbic punishment centers, and stimuli that cause pleasure, happiness, or sense of reward excite the limbic reward centers. All these together provide the background mood and motivations of the person. Among these motivations is the drive in the brain to remember those experiences and thoughts that are either pleasant or unpleasant. The hippocampi especially and to a lesser degree the dorsal medial nuclei of the thalamus, another limbic structure, have proved especially important in making the decision about which of our thoughts are important enough on a basis of reward or punishment to be worthy of memory.",

          "In some people who have hippocampal lesions, some degree of retrograde amnesia occurs along with antero- grade amnesia, which suggests that these two types of amnesia are at least partially related and that hippocam- pal lesions can cause both. However, damage in some tha- lamic areas may lead specifically to retrograde amnesia without causing significant anterograde amnesia. A possi- ble explanation of this is that the thalamus may play a role in helping the person “search” the memory storehouses and thus “read out” the memories. That is, the memory process not only requires the storing of memories but also an ability to search and find the memory at a later date. The possible function of the thalamus in this process is discussed further in Chapter 59.",
          "Hippocampi Are Not Important in Reflexive Learning. People with hippocampal lesions usually do not have dif- ficulty in learning physical skills that do not involve ver- balization or symbolic types of intelligence. For example, these people can still learn the rapid hand and physical skills required in many types of sports. This type of learn- ing is called skill learning or reflexive learning; it depends on physically repeating the required tasks over and over again, rather than on symbolic rehearsing in the mind."

          "Figure 59-1 shows a general system for controlling the activity level of the brain. The central driving component of this system is an excitatory area located in the reticular substance of the pons and mesencephalon. This area is also called the bulboreticular facilitory area. We also discuss this area in Chapter 56 because it is the same brain stem reticular area that transmits facilitory signals downward to the spinal cord to maintain tone in the antigravity muscles and to control levels of activity of the spinal cord reflexes. In addition to these downward signals, this area also sends a profusion of signals in the upward direction. Most of these signals go first to the thalamus, where they excite a different set of neurons that transmit nerve sig- nals to all regions of the cerebral cortex, as well as to mul- tiple subcortical areas.",
          "The signals passing through the thalamus are of two types. One type is rapidly transmitted action potentials that excite the cerebrum for only a few milliseconds. These signals originate from large neuronal cell bodies that lie throughout the brain stem reticular area. Their nerve endings release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which serves as an excitatory agent that lasts for only a few milliseconds before it is destroyed.",
          "The second type of excitatory signal originates from large numbers of small neurons spread throughout the brain stem reticular excitatory area. Again, most of these signals pass to the thalamus, but through small, slowly conducting fibers that synapse mainly in the intralami- nar nuclei of the thalamus and in the reticular nuclei over the surface of the thalamus. From here, additional small fibers are distributed throughout the cerebral cortex. The excitatory effect caused by this system of fibers can build up progressively for many seconds to a minute or more, which suggests that its signals are especially important for controlling the longer term background excitability level of the brain.",
          "Excitation of the Reticular Excitatory Area by Periph- eral Sensory Signals. The level of activity of the reticular excitatory area in the brain stem, and therefore the level of activity of the entire brain, is determined to a great ex- tent by the number and type of sensory signals that en- ter the brain from the periphery. Pain signals in particu- lar increase activity in this excitatory area and therefore strongly excite the brain to attention.",
          "The importance of sensory signals in activating the excitatory area is demonstrated by the effect of cutting the brain stem above the point where the fifth cerebral nerves enter the pons. These nerves are the highest nerves entering the brain that transmit significant numbers of somatosensory signals into the brain. When all these input sensory signals are gone, the level of activity in the brain excitatory area diminishes abruptly, and the brain proceeds instantly to a state of greatly reduced activity, approaching a permanent state of coma. However, when the brain stem is transected below the fifth nerves, which leaves much input of sensory signals from the facial and oral regions, the coma is averted.",
          "Increased Activity of the Excitatory Area Caused by Feedback Signals Returning From the Cerebral Cortex. Not only do excitatory signals pass to the cerebral cortex from the bulboreticular excitatory area of the brain stem, but feedback signals also return from the cerebral cortex back to this same area. Therefore, any time the cer- ebral cortex becomes activated by brain thought process- es or by motor processes, signals are sent from the cortex to the brain stem excitatory area, which in turn sends still more excitatory signals to the cortex. This process helps to maintain the level of excitation of the cerebral cortex or even to enhance it. This is a positive feedback mechanism that allows any beginning activity in the cerebral cortex to support still more activity, thus leading to an “awake” mind.",
          "The Thalamus Is a Distribution Center That Controls Activity in Specific Regions of the Cortex. As pointed out in Chapter 58, almost every area of the cerebral cortex connects with its own highly specific area in the thalamus. Therefore, electrical stimulation of a specific point in the thalamus generally activates its own specific small region of the cortex. Furthermore, signals regularly reverberate back and forth between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, with the thalamus exciting the cortex and the cor- tex then re-exciting the thalamus via return fibers. Acti- vation of these back-and-forth reverberation signals has been suggested to establish long-term memories. Whether the thalamus also functions to call forth specific memories from the cortex or to activate specific thought processes is still unclear, but the thalamus does have appropriate neuronal circuitry for these purposes."

As would be expected, these three systems have different effects on levels of excitability in different parts of the brain.

          "Neurohormonal Systems in the Human Brain. Figure 59-3 shows the brain stem areas in the human brain for activating four neurohormonal systems, the same three discussed for the rat and one other, the acetylcholine sys- tem. Some of the specific functions of these systems are as follows. m 1. The locus ceruleus and the norepinephrine system. The locus ceruleus is a small area located bilaterally and posteriorly at the juncture between the pons and mesencephalon. Nerve fibers from this area spread throughout the brain, the same as shown for the rat in the top frame of Figure 59-2, and they secrete nor- epinephrine. The norepinephrine generally excites the brain to increased activity. However, it has inhibi- tory effects in a few brain areas because of inhibitory receptors at certain neuronal synapses. Chapter 60 describes how this system probably plays an impor- tant role in causing dreaming, thus leading to a type of sleep called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. m 2. The substantia nigra and the dopamine system. The substantia nigra is discussed in Chapter 57 in relation to the basal ganglia. It lies anteriorly in the superior mesencephalon, and its neurons send nerve endings mainly to the caudate nucleus and putamen of the cerebrum, where they secrete dopamine. Other neu- rons located in adjacent regions also secrete dopa- mine, but they send their endings into more ventral areas of the brain, especially to the hypothalamus and the limbic system. The dopamine is believed to act as an inhibitory transmitter in the basal ganglia, but in some other areas of the brain it is possibly excitatory. Also, remember from Chapter 57 that destruction of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is the basic cause of Parkinson's disease. m 3. The raphe nuclei and the serotonin system. In the midline of the pons and medulla are several thin nuclei called the raphe nuclei. Many of the neurons in these nuclei secrete serotonin. They send fibers into the di- encephalon and a few fibers to the cerebral cortex; still other fibers descend to the spinal cord. The serotonin secreted at the cord fiber endings has the ability to suppress pain, which was discussed in Chapter 49. The serotonin released in the diencephalon and cerebrum almost certainly plays an essential inhibitory role to help cause normal sleep, as we discuss in Chapter 60. m 4. The gigantocellular neurons of the reticular excitatory area and the acetylcholine system. We previously dis- cussed the gigantocellular neurons (giant cells) in the reticular excitatory area of the pons and mesencepha- lon. The fibers from these large cells divide immedi- ately into two branches, one passing upward to the higher levels of the brain and the other passing down- ward through the reticulospinal tracts into the spinal cord. The neurohormone secreted at their terminals is acetylcholine. In most places, the acetylcholine functions as an excitatory neurotransmitter. Activa- tion of these acetylcholine neurons leads to an acutely awake and excited nervous system.",
          "Other Neurotransmitters and Neurohormonal Sub- stances Secreted in the Brain. Without describing their function, the following is a partial list of still other neuro- hormonal substances that function either at specific syn- apses or by release into the fluids of the brain: enkepha- lins, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, vasopressin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (c-MSH), neuropeptide-Y (NPY), epinephrine, histamine, endorphins, angiotensin II, and neurotensin.

          "An important route of communication between the limbic system and the brain stem is the medial forebrain bundle, which extends from the septal and orbitofron- tal regions of the cerebral cortex downward through the middle of the hypothalamus to the brain stem reticular formation. This bundle carries fibers in both directions, forming a trunk line communication system. A  sec- ond route of communication is through short pathways among the reticular formation of the brain stem, thala- mus, hypothalamus, and most other contiguous areas of the basal brain."

          "The hypothalamus, despite its small size of only a few cubic centimeters (weighing only about 4 grams), has two-way communicating pathways with all levels of the limbic system. In turn, the hypothalamus and its closely allied structures send output signals in three directions: (1) backward and downward to the brain stem, mainly into the reticular areas of the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla, and from these areas into the peripheral nerves of the autonomic nervous system; (2) upward toward many higher areas of the diencephalon and cerebrum, especially to the anterior thalamus and limbic portions of the cerebral cortex; and (3) into the hypothalamic infundibulum to control or partially control most of the secretory functions of both the posterior and the ante- rior pituitary glands.",
          "Thus, the hypothalamus, which represents less than 1% of the brain mass, is one of the most important of the con- trol pathways of the limbic system. It controls most of the vegetative and endocrine functions of the body and many aspects of emotional behavior."

          "The different hypothalamic mechanisms for controlling multiple functions of the body are so important that they are discussed in multiple chapters throughout this text. For example, the role of the hypothalamus to help regu- late arterial pressure is discussed in Chapter 18, thirst and water conservation in Chapter 30, appetite and energy expenditure in Chapter 72, temperature regulation in Chapter 74, and endocrine control in Chapter 76. To illus- trate the organization of the hypothalamus as a functional unit, we summarize the a few of its vegetative and endo- crine functions here as well.",
          "Figures 59-6 and 59-7 show enlarged sagittal and cor- onal views of the hypothalamus, which represents only a small area in Figure 59-4. Especially note in Figure 59-6 the multiple activities that are excited or inhibited when respective hypothalamic nuclei are stimulated. In addition to these centers, a large lateral hypothalamic area (shown in Figure 59-7) is present on each side of the hypothala- mus. The lateral areas are especially important in control- ling thirst, hunger, and many of the emotional drives.",
          "A word of caution must be issued when studying these diagrams because the areas that cause specific activities are not nearly as accurately localized as suggested in the figures. Also, it is not known whether the effects noted in the figures result from stimulation of specific control nuclei or merely from activation of fiber tracts lead- ing from or to control nuclei located elsewhere. With this caution in mind, we can give the following general description of the vegetative and control functions of the hypothalamus.",
          "Cardiovascular Regulation. Stimulation of different ar- eas throughout the hypothalamus can cause many neu- rogenic effects on the cardiovascular system, including changes in arterial pressure and heart rate. In general, stimulation in the posterior and lateral hypothalamus increases the arterial pressure and heart rate, whereas stimulation in the preoptic area often has opposite effects, causing a decrease in both heart rate and arterial pressure. These effects are transmitted mainly through specific car- diovascular control centers in the reticular regions of the pons and medulla.",
          "Body Temperature Regulation. The anterior portion of the hypothalamus, especially the preoptic area, is con- cerned with regulation of body temperature. An increase in temperature of the blood flowing through this area in- creases activity of temperature-sensitive neurons, where- as a decrease in temperature decreases their activity. In turn, these neurons control mechanisms for increasing or decreasing body temperature, as discussed in Chapter 74.",
          "Body Water Regulation. The hypothalamus regulates body water in two ways: (1) by creating the sensation of thirst, which drives the animal or person to drink water, and (2) by controlling the excretion of water into the urine. An area called the thirst center is located in the lateral hypothalamus. When the fluid electrolytes in ei- ther this center or closely allied areas become too con- centrated, the animal develops an intense desire to drink water; it will search out the nearest source of water and drink enough to return the electrolyte concentration of the thirst center to normal.",
          "Control of renal excretion of water is vested mainly in the supraoptic nuclei. When the body fluids become too concentrated, the neurons of these areas become stimu- lated. Nerve fibers from these neurons project downward through the infundibulum of the hypothalamus into the posterior pituitary gland, where the nerve endings secrete the hormone antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopres- sin). This hormone is then absorbed into the blood and transported to the kidneys, where it acts on the collect- ing tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to cause increased reabsorption of water. This action decreases loss of water into the urine but allows continuing excre- tion of electrolytes, thus decreasing the concentration of the body fluids back toward normal. These functions are presented in Chapter 29.",
          "Regulation of Uterine Contractility and Milk Ejection from the Breasts. Stimulation of the paraventricular nuclei causes their neuronal cells to secrete the hormone oxytocin. This hormone in turn causes increased contrac- tility of the uterus, as well as contraction of the myoepi- thelial cells surrounding the alveoli of the breasts, which then causes the alveoli to empty their milk through the nipples.",
          "At the end of pregnancy, especially large quantities of oxytocin are secreted, and this secretion helps promote labor contractions that expel the baby. Then, whenever the baby suckles the mother’s breast, a reflex signal from the nipple to the posterior hypothalamus also causes oxy- tocin release, and the oxytocin now performs the neces- sary function of contracting the ductules of the breast, thereby expelling milk through the nipples so that the baby can nourish itself. These functions are discussed in Chapter 83.",
          "Gastrointestinal and Feeding Regulation. Stimulation of several areas of the hypothalamus causes an animal to experience extreme hunger, a voracious appetite, and an intense desire to search for food. One area associated with hunger is the lateral hypothalamic area. Conversely, damage to this area on both sides of the hypothalamus causes the animal to lose desire for food, sometimes caus- ing lethal starvation, as discussed in Chapter 72.",
          "A center that opposes the desire for food, called the satiety center, is located in the ventromedial nuclei. When this center is stimulated electrically, an animal that is eating food suddenly stops eating and shows complete indifference to food. However, if this area is destroyed bilaterally, the animal cannot be satiated; instead, its hypothalamic hunger centers become overactive, so it has a voracious appetite, resulting eventually in tremen- dous obesity. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus contains at least two different types neurons that, when stimulated, lead either to increased or decreased appetite. Another area of the hypothalamus that enters into overall control of gastrointestinal activity is the mammillary bod- ies, which control at least partially the patterns of many feeding reflexes, such as licking the lips and swallowing.",
          "Hypothalamic Control of Endocrine Hormone Secre- tion by the Anterior Pituitary Gland. Stimulation of certain areas of the hypothalamus also causes the anterior pituitary gland to secrete its endocrine hormones. This subject is discussed in detail in Chapter 75 in relation to neural control of the endocrine glands. Briefly, the basic mechanisms are as follows. The anterior pituitary gland receives its blood supply mainly from blood that flows first through the lower part of the hypothalamus and then through the anterior pituitary vascular sinuses. As the blood courses through the hypothalamus before reach- ing the anterior pituitary, specific releasing and inhibitory hormones are secreted into the blood by various hypotha- lamic nuclei. These hormones are then transported via the blood to the anterior pituitary gland, where they act on the glandular cells to control release of specific ante- rior pituitary hormones.",
          "Hypothalamic Control of Circadian Rhythms—The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus. The suprachiasmatic nu- cleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains about 20,000 neurons and is located above the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross underneath the hypothalamus, as dis- cussed in Chapter 52. The neurons of the SCN serve as a “master clock,’ with a pacemaker firing frequency that follows a circadian rhythm (Figure 59-8). This pacemaker function is critical for organizing sleep into a recurring 24-hour circadian pattern of sleeping and waking. Le- sions of the SCN cause many physiological and behavioral disturbances, including loss of the circadian sleep-wake rhythms. Thus, the SCN directs daily cycles of our physi- ology and behavior that set the tempo of our lives. The importance of these daily cycles to human health has led to increasing interest in the field of chronobiology, the study of these circadian rhythms. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the cir- cadian rhythm in fruit flies.",
          "Figure 59-8 The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus serves as a “master clock” for many physiological, mental, and behav- ioral activities. The SCN receives direct innervation from the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) to entrain its activity to day-night cycles. SCN neurons project to various brain centers, which contain local circadian clocks that direct feeding-fasting, sleep—wakefulness, autonomic and neuroendocrine circadian rhythms. These systemic cues synchronize local molecular clocks in peripheral tissues, and these local clocks then direct circadian gene expression that regulates physiological rhythms, including those related to mental alertness and cognition, cardiovascular regulation, metabolism, and renal function.",
          "The SCN is organized into specific functional groups that control the rhythmic patterns of biological clocks in other parts of the body. These biological clocks are comprised of a complex set of gene transcription factors, proteins/enzymes, and other regulator factors that oper- ate to establish circadian rhythms in most living organ- isms including mammals, microbes, and even plants. These biological clocks are found in nearly every tissue and organ of the body and capable of maintaining their own circadian rhythms, although their circadian rhythms are usually maintained for only a few days in the absence of signals from the SCN.",
          "Key components of the clock mechanisms in the SCN, and in other tissues, are two feedback loops that rely on the transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, which bind to each other and, following translocation to the nucleus, initiate transcription of “clock genes” (PERI, PER2, and PER3) and “cryptochrome genes” (CRY1 and CRY2). These genes turn on synthesis of PER and CRY proteins; as the proteins accumulate, they inhibit CLOCK and BMAL1, thereby repressing PER and CRY transcrip- tion. This feedback sequence of on-off PER and CRY protein synthesis normally occurs in a 24-hour circadian pattern.",
          "Once the SCN clock has established its circadian rhythm, this information is transmitted to other brain regions through action potentials and to various organs and tissues via nervous and hormonal signals. Axons from the SCN project to other regions of the hypothala- mus that are especially important for circadian variations in body temperature, the sleep-wake cycle, and various hormonal changes.",
          "Although the circadian rhythms of the SCN are endogenous and_ self-sustained, they are altered (“entrained”) by environmental changes such as tem- perature and timing of the light-dark cycle. The SCN receives neural input from specialized intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that contain the photopigment melanopsin and transmit signals through the retinohypothalamic tract. The importance of this pathway in altering the timing of circadian rhythms is illustrated by the observation that a person who travels across several time zones may experience “jet lag’ but his or her circadian clock is eventually synchronized with local day-night time.",
          "Summary. Several areas of the hypothalamus control specific vegetative and endocrine functions. The func- tions of these areas are not fully understood, so the specification given earlier of different areas for different hypothalamic functions is still partially tentative."

In addition to the vegetative and endocrine functions of the hypothalamus, stimulation of or lesions in the hy- pothalamus often have profound effects on emotional behavior of animals and human beings. Some of the behavioral effects of stimulation are the following: m 1. Stimulation in the lateral hypothalamus not only causes thirst and eating, as discussed earlier, but also increases the general level of activity of the ani- mal, sometimes leading to overt rage and fighting, discussed subsequently. m 2. Stimulation in the ventromedial nucleus and sur- rounding areas mainly causes effects opposite to those caused by lateral hypothalamic stimulation— that is, a sense of satiety, decreased eating, and tran- quility. m 3. Stimulation of a thin zone of periventricular nuclei, located immediately adjacent to the third ventricle (or also stimulation of the central gray area of the mesencephalon that is continuous with this portion of the hypothalamus), usually leads to fear and pun- ishment reactions. m 4. Sexual drive can be stimulated from several areas of the hypothalamus, especially the most anterior and most posterior portions.",
          "Effects Caused by Hypothalamic Lesions. Lesions in the hypothalamus, in general, cause effects opposite to those caused by stimulation, such as the following: m 1. Bilateral lesions in the lateral hypothalamus will decrease drinking and eating almost to zero, often leading to lethal starvation. These lesions cause ex- treme passivity of the animal as well, with loss of most of its overt drives. m 2. Bilateral lesions of the ventromedial areas of the hy- pothalamus cause effects that are mainly opposite to those caused by lesions of the lateral hypothala- mus: excessive drinking and eating, as well as hy- peractivity and often frequent bouts of extreme rage on the slightest provocation.",
          "Stimulation or lesions in other regions of the limbic system, especially in the amygdala, the septal area, and areas in the mesencephalon, often cause effects similar to those elicited from the hypothalamus. We discuss some of these effects in more detail later."

Electrical stimulation of certain limbic areas pleases or satisfies the animal, whereas elec- trical stimulation of other regions causes terror, pain, fear, defense, escape reactions, and all the other elements of punishment.

It is interesting that the lateral nucleus is included among the reward areas because strong stimuli in this area can actually cause rage. However, this phe- nomenon occurs in many areas, with weaker stimuli giving a sense of reward and stronger ones a sense of punishment. Less potent reward centers, which are per- haps secondary to the major ones in the hypothalamus, are found in the septum, the amygdala, certain areas of the thalamus and basal ganglia, and extending down- ward into the basal tegmentum of the mesencephalon."

Electrical recordings from the brain show that a newly experienced sensory stimulus almost always excites multiple areas in the cerebral cortex. How- ever, if the sensory experience does not elicit a sense of either reward or punishment, repetition of the stimulus over and over leads to almost complete extinction of the cerebral cortical response—that is, the animal becomes habituated to that specific sensory stimulus and thereaf- ter ignores it.",

One end of the hippocampus abuts the amygdaloid nuclei, and along its lateral border it fuses with the parahippocampal gyrus, which is the cerebral cortex on the ventromedial outside surface of the temporal lobe.",
          "The hippocampus (and its adjacent temporal and pari- etal lobe structures, all together called the hippocampal formation) has numerous but mainly indirect connections with many portions of the cerebral cortex, as well as with the basal structures of the limbic system—the amygdala, hypothalamus, septum, and mammillary bodies. Almost any type of sensory experience causes activation of at least some part of the hippocampus, and the hippocampus in turn distributes many outgoing signals to the anterior thalamus, hypothalamus, and other parts of the limbic sys- tem, especially through the fornix, a major communicating pathway. Thus, the hippocampus is an additional channel through which incoming sensory signals can initiate behav- ioral reactions for different purposes. As in other limbic structures, stimulation of different areas in the hippocam- pus can cause almost any of the different behavioral pat- terns such as pleasure, rage, passivity, or excess sex drive.",
          "Another feature of the hippocampus is that it can become hyperexcitable. For example, weak electrical stimuli can cause focal epileptic seizures in small areas of the hippocampi. These seizures often persist for many seconds after the stimulation is over, suggesting that the hippocampi can perhaps give off prolonged output sig- nals, even under normal functioning conditions. During hippocampal seizures, the person experiences various psychomotor effects, including olfactory, visual, auditory, tactile, and other types of hallucinations that cannot be suppressed as long as the seizure persists, even though the person has not lost consciousness and knows these hallucinations to be unreal. Probably one of the reasons for this hyperexcitability of the hippocampi is that they have a different type of cortex from that elsewhere in the cerebrum, with only three nerve cell layers in some of its areas instead of the six layers found elsewhere."

In many lower animals, this cortex plays essential roles in determining whether the animal will eat a particular food, whether the smell of a particular object suggests danger, or whether the odor is sexually inviting, thus making decisions that are of life-or-death importance. Very early in evolutionary development of the brain, the hippocampus presumably became a criti- cal decision-making neuronal mechanism, determining the importance of the incoming sensory signals. Once this critical decision-making capability had been estab- lished, presumably the remainder of the brain also began to call on the hippocampus for decision making. There- fore, if the hippocampus signals that a neuronal input is important, the information is likely to be committed to memory.",

But what is the mechanism by which this occurs? It has been sug- gested that the hippocampus provides the drive that causes translation of short-term memory into long- term memory—that is, the hippocampus transmits signals that seem to make the mind rehearse over and over the new information until permanent storage takes place. Whatever the mechanism, without the hip- pocampi, consolidation of long-term memories of the verbal or symbolic thinking type is poor or does not take place."

It was noted in Chapter 54 that one of the major divisions of the olfactory tract terminates in a portion of the amygdala called the corticomedial nuclei, which lies immediately beneath the cerebral cortex in the olfactory pyriform area of the temporal lobe. In the hu- man being, another portion of the amygdala, the basolat- eral nuclei, has become much more highly developed than the olfactory portion and plays important roles in many behavioral activities not generally associated with olfac- tory stimuli.",

In the middle and posterior cingulate cor- tex, there is reason to believe that sensorimotor behavioral associations occur."

          "All of us are aware of the many different states of brain activity, including sleep, wakefulness, extreme excite- ment, and even different levels of mood such as exhila- ration, depression, and fear. All these states result from different activating or inhibiting forces generated usually within the brain. In Chapter 59, we began a partial discus- sion of this subject when we described different systems that are capable of activating large portions of the brain. In this chapter, we present brief surveys of specific states of brain activity, beginning with sleep.",
          "Sleep is defined as unconsciousness from which a per- son can be aroused by sensory or other stimuli. It is to be distinguished from coma, which is unconsciousness from which a person cannot be aroused. There are mul- tiple stages of sleep, from very light sleep to very deep sleep. Sleep researchers also divide sleep into two entirely different types of sleep that have different qualities, as described in the following section."

          "Each night, a person goes through stages of two major types of sleep that alternate with each other (Figure 60-1). These types are called (1) rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep), in which the eyes undergo rapid movements even though the person is still asleep, and (2) slow-wave sleep or non-REM (NREM) sleep, in which the brain waves are strong and of low frequency, as we discuss later.",
          "REM sleep occurs in episodes that occupy about 25% of the sleep time in young adults; each episode normally recurs about every 90 minutes. This type of sleep is not so restful, and it is often associated with vivid dreaming. Most sleep during each night is of the slow-wave (NREM) variety, which is the deep, restful sleep that the person experiences during the first hour of sleep after having been awake for many hours."

When a person is extremely sleepy, each bout of REM sleep is short and may even be absent. As the person becomes more rested through the night, the durations of the REM bouts increase.",
          "REM sleep has several important characteristics: m 1. It is an active form of sleep usually associated with dreaming and active bodily muscle movements. m 2. The person is even more difficult to arouse by sen- sory stimuli than during deep slow-wave sleep, and yet people usually awaken spontaneously in the morning during an episode of REM sleep. m 3. Muscle tone throughout the body is exceedingly depressed, indicating strong inhibition of the spinal muscle control areas. m 4. Heart rate and respiratory rate usually become ir- regular, which is characteristic of the dream state. m 5. Despite the extreme inhibition of the peripheral muscles, irregular muscle movements do occur in addition to the rapid movements of the eyes. m 6. The brain is highly active in REM sleep, and overall brain metabolism may be increased as much as 20%. An electroencephalogram (EEG) shows a pattern of brain waves similar to those that occur during wakefulness. This type of sleep is also called para- doxical sleep because it is a paradox that a person can still be asleep, despite the presence of marked activity in the brain. m In summary, REM sleep is a type of sleep in which the brain is quite active. However, the person is not fully aware of the surroundings and therefore is truly asleep."

For example, 10% to 30% decreases occur in blood pressure, respiratory rate, and basal metabolic rate.",

The difference between the dreams that occur in slow-wave sleep and those that occur in REM sleep is that those of REM sleep are associ- ated with more bodily muscle activity. Also, the dreams of slow-wave sleep are usually not remembered because consolidation of the dreams in memory does not occur."

          "Sleep Is Caused by an Active Inhibitory Process. An earlier theory of sleep was that the excitatory ar- eas of the upper brain stem, the reticular activating system, simply became fatigued during the waking day and became inactive as a result. An important experi- ment changed this thinking to the current view that sleep is caused by an active inhibitory process, because it was discovered that transecting the brain stem at the level of the midpons creates a brain cortex that never goes to sleep. In other words, a center located below the midpontile level of the brain stem appears to be required to cause sleep by inhibiting other parts of the brain."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Stimulation of several specific areas of the brain can pro- duce sleep with characteristics near those of natural sleep. Some of these areas are the following: m 1. The raphe nuclei in the lower half of the pons and in the medulla is the most conspicuous stimulation area for causing almost natural sleep. These nuclei comprise a thin sheet of special neurons located in the midline. Nerve fibers from these nuclei spread locally in the brain stem reticular formation and also upward into the thalamus, hypothalamus, most areas of the limbic system, and even the neocortex of the cerebrum. In addition, fibers extend down- ward into the spinal cord, terminating in the poste- rior horns, where they can inhibit incoming sensory signals, including pain, as discussed in Chapter 49. Many nerve endings of fibers from these raphe neu- rons secrete serotonin. When a drug that blocks the formation of serotonin is administered to an animal, the animal often cannot sleep for the next several days. Therefore, it has been assumed that serotonin is a transmitter substance associated with the pro- duction of sleep. m 2. Stimulation of some areas in the nucleus of the trac- tus solitarius can also cause sleep. This nucleus is the termination in the medulla and pons for visceral sensory signals entering by way of the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. m 3. Sleep can be promoted by stimulation of several re- gions in the diencephalon, including (1) the rostral part of the hypothalamus, mainly in the suprachi- asmal area, and (2) an occasional area in the diffuse nuclei of the thalamus.",
          "Lesions in Sleep-Promoting Centers Can Cause In- tense Wakefulness. Discrete lesions in the raphe nuclei lead to a high state of wakefulness. This phenomenon is also true of bilateral lesions in the medial rostral suprachi- asmal area in the anterior hypothalamus. In both cases, the excitatory reticular nuclei of the mesencephalon and upper pons seem to become released from inhibition, thus causing intense wakefulness. Indeed, sometimes le- sions of the anterior hypothalamus can cause such intense wakefulness that the animal actually dies of exhaustion.",
          "Other Possible Transmitter Substances Related to Sleep. Experiments have shown that the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood or urine of animals that have been kept awake for several days contain a substance or substances that will cause sleep when injected into the brain ven- tricular system of another animal. One likely substance has been identified as muramyl peptide, a low-molecular- weight substance that accumulates in the cerebrospinal fluid and urine in animals kept awake for several days. When only micrograms of this sleep-producing sub- stance are injected into the third ventricle, almost natural sleep occurs within a few minutes, and the animal may stay asleep for several hours.",
          "Another substance that has similar effects in causing sleep is delta sleep—inducing peptide, a nonapeptide found in the cerebrospinal fluid after electrical stimulation of the thalamus to induce sleep. Several other potential sleep factors, mostly peptides, have been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid or neuronal tissues of the brain stem of animals kept awake for days. It is possible that prolonged wakefulness causes progressive accumulation of a sleep factor or factors in the brain stem or cerebrospinal fluid that lead(s) to sleep.",
          "Possible Cause of REM Sleep. It is not understood why slow-wave sleep is broken periodically by REM sleep. However, drugs that mimic the action of acetylcholine increase the occurrence of REM sleep. Therefore, it has been postulated that the large acetylcholine-secreting neurons in the upper brain stem reticular formation might, through their extensive efferent fibers, activate many portions of the brain. This mechanism theoretically could cause the increased activity that occurs in certain brain regions in REM sleep, even though the signals are not channeled appropriately in the brain to cause normal conscious awareness that is characteristic of wakefulness."

There is as yet no definitive explanation. Therefore, we might suggest the following possible mechanism for causing the sleep- wakefulness cycle.",
          "When the sleep centers are not activated, the mesen- cephalic and upper pontile reticular activating nuclei are released from inhibition, which allows the reticular acti- vating nuclei to become spontaneously active. This spon- taneous activity in turn excites both the cerebral cortex and the peripheral nervous system, both of which send numerous positive feedback signals back to the same reticular activating nuclei to activate them still further.",
          "Therefore, once wakefulness begins, it has a natural ten- dency to sustain itself because of all this positive feedback activity.",
          "Then, after the brain remains activated for many hours, even the neurons in the activating system presumably become fatigued. Consequently, the positive feedback cycle between the mesencephalic reticular nuclei and the cerebral cortex fades and the sleep-promoting effects of the sleep centers take over, leading to rapid transition from wakefulness back to sleep.",
          "This overall theory could explain the rapid transitions from sleep to wakefulness and from wakefulness to sleep. It could also explain arousal—that is, the insomnia that occurs when a person's mind becomes preoccupied with a thought—and the wakefulness that is produced by bodily physical activity.",
          "Role of Orexin Neurons in Arousal and Wakefulness. Orexin (also called hypocretin) is produced by neurons in the hypothalamus that provide excitatory input to many other areas of the brain where there are orexin receptors. Orexin neurons are most active during waking and almost stop firing during slow wave and REM sleep. Loss of orexin signaling as a result of defective orexin receptors or de- struction of orexin-producing neurons causes narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep that can occur, even when a person is talking or working. Patients with narcolepsy may also experience a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy) that can be partial or even severe enough to cause paralysis during the attack. These observations point to an important role for orexin neurons in maintain- ing wakefulness, but their contribution to the normal daily cycle between sleep and wakefulness is unclear."

It exists in all mammals, and after total deprivation there is usually a period of “catch-up” or “rebound” sleep; after selec- tive deprivation of REM or slow-wave sleep, there is also a selective rebound of these specific stages of sleep. Even mild sleep restriction over a few days may degrade cogni- tive and physical performance, overall productivity, and the health of a person. The essential role of sleep in homeostasis is perhaps most vividly demonstrated by the fact that rats deprived of sleep for 2 to 3 weeks may actually die. Despite the obvious importance of sleep, our understanding of why sleep is an essential part of life is still limited.",
          "Sleep causes two major types of physiological effects: first, effects on the nervous system, and second, effects on other functional systems of the body. Mammals, and even invertebrate animals, sleep more in the setting of infec- tious as well as non-infectious illnesses. Sickness-induced sleep has been suggested to be a beneficial response that diverts the organism's energy resources from neural and motor demands to fighting off infectious or injurious insults.",
          "Lack of sleep certainly affects the functions of the central nervous system. Prolonged wakefulness is often associated with progressive malfunction of the thought processes and sometimes even causes abnormal behav- ioral activities. We are all familiar with the increased sluggishness of thought that occurs toward the end of a prolonged wakeful period, but in addition, a person can become irritable or even psychotic after forced wake- fulness. Therefore, we can assume that sleep in multiple ways restores both normal levels of brain activity and nor- mal “balance” among the different functions of the central nervous system.",
          "Sleep has been postulated to serve many functions, including the following: (1) neural maturation; (2) facilita- tion of learning or memory; (3) targeted erasure of syn- apses to “forget” unimportant information that might clutter the synaptic network; (4) cognition; (5) clearance of metabolic waste products generated by neural activ- ity in the awake brain; and (6) conservation of metabolic energy. There is some evidence for each of these func- tions, but evidence supporting each of these ideas has been challenged. We might postulate that the principal value of sleep is to restore natural balances among the neu- ronal centers, which is necessary for overall health. The specific physiological functions of sleep, however, remain a mystery and are the subject of much research."

The undulations in the recorded electrical potentials, shown in Figure 60-2, are called brain waves, and the entire record is called an electroencephalogram (EEG).",

These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be re- corded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. Their voltage is usually about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear.",
          "When the awake person’s attention is directed to some specific type of mental activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous, higher frequency but lower voltage beta waves. Figure 60-3 shows the effect on the alpha waves of simply opening the eyes in bright light and then closing the eyes. Note that the visual sensations cause immediate ces- sation of the alpha waves and that these waves are replaced by low-voltage, asynchronous beta waves.",

          "The discharge of a single neuron or single nerve fiber in the brain can never be recorded from the surface of the head. Instead, many thousands or even millions of neurons or fibers must fire synchronously for the potentials from the individual neurons or fibers to summate enough to be re- corded through the skull. Thus, the intensity of the brain waves from the scalp is determined mainly by the numbers of neurons and fibers that fire in synchrony with one an- other, not by the total level of electrical activity in the brain. In fact, strong nonsynchronous nerve signals often nullify one another in the recorded brain waves because of oppos- ing polarities. This phenomenon is demonstrated in Figure 60-3, which shows, when the eyes were closed, synchro- nous discharge of many neurons in the cerebral cortex at a frequency of about 12/sec, thus causing alpha waves. Then, when the eyes were opened, the activity of the brain in- creased greatly, but synchronization of the signals became so little that the brain waves mainly nullified one another. The resultant effect was low voltage waves of generally high but irregular frequency, the beta waves.",
          "Origin of Alpha Waves. Alpha waves will not occur in the cerebral cortex without cortical connections with the thalamus. Conversely, stimulation in the nonspecific layer of reticular nuclei that surround the thalamus or in “dif- fuse” nuclei deep inside the thalamus often sets up elec- trical waves in the thalamocortical system at a frequency between 8 and 13/sec, which is the natural frequency of the alpha waves. Therefore, alpha waves are thought to re- sult from spontaneous feedback oscillation in this diffuse thalamocortical system, possibly including the reticular ac- tivating system in the brain stem as well. This oscillation presumably causes the periodicity of the alpha waves and the synchronous activation of literally millions of cortical neurons during each wave.",
          "Origin of Delta Waves. Transection of the fiber tracts from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, which blocks tha- lamic activation of the cortex and thereby eliminates the alpha waves, nevertheless does not block delta waves in the cortex. This indicates that some synchronizing mechanism can occur in the cortical neuronal system by itself—mainly independent of lower structures in the brain—to cause the delta waves.",

They can be caused by multiple neurological or medical conditions, such as acute electrolyte disorders, hypoglycemia, drugs (e.g., cocaine), eclampsia, kidney failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, meningitis, and so forth. Approximately 5% to 10% of the population will have at least one seizure in their lifetime.",

Epilepsy is not a single disease. Its clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and reflect multi- ple underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that cause cerebral dysfunction and injury, such as trauma, stroke, tumors, infection, or degenerative changes. Hereditary fac- tors appear to be important, although a specific cause can- not be identified in many patients and several factors may coexist, reflecting an acquired brain pathology and genetic predisposition.

          "These lesions can promote extremely rapid discharges in the local neurons; when the discharge rate rises above several hundred per second, synchronous waves begin to spread over adjacent cortical regions. These waves presum- ably result from localized reverberating circuits that may gradually recruit adjacent areas of the cortex into the epi- leptic discharge zone. The process spreads to adjacent areas at a rate as slow as a few millimeters per minute to as fast as several centimeters per second.",
          "Focal seizures can spread locally from a focus or more re- motely to the contralateral cortex and subcortical areas of the brain through projections to the thalamus, which has wide- spread connections to both hemispheres (Figure 60-5). When such a wave of excitation spreads over the motor cortex, it causes a progressive “march” of muscle contractions through- out the opposite side of the body, beginning most characteris- tically in the mouth region and marching progressively down- ward to the legs but at other times marching in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is called Jacksonian march. The time after the seizure, prior to the return of normal neu- rological function, is called the postictal period. Focal seizures are often classified as simple partial sei- zures when there is no major change in consciousness or as complex partial seizures when consciousness is impaired. Simple partial seizures may be preceded by an aura, with sensations such as fear, followed by motor signs, such as rhythmic jerking or tonic stiffening movements of a body part. A focal epileptic attack may remain confined to a single area of the brain, often the temporal lobe, but in some cases strong signals spread from the focal region, and the person may lose consciousness. Complex partial seizures may also begin with an aura followed by impaired consciousness and strange repetitive movements (automatisms), such as chew- ing or lip smacking. After recovery from the seizure the per- son may have no memory of the attack, except for the aura.",

Therefore, a generalized tonic-clonic seizure presumably involves not only abnormal activation of the thalamus and cerebral cortex but also abnormal acti- vation in the subthalamic brain stem portions of the brain- activating system.",
          "What Initiates a Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure? The majority of generalized seizures are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown. Many people who have generalized tonic-clonic attacks have a heredi- tary predisposition to epilepsy, a predisposition that oc- curs in about 1 of every 100 persons. In these people, factors that can increase the excitability of the abnormal “epileptogenic” circuitry enough to precipitate attacks include (1) strong emotional stimuli, (2) alkalosis caused by overbreathing, (3) drugs, (4) fever, and (5) loud noises or flashing lights.",
          "Even in people who are not genetically predisposed, certain types of traumatic lesions in almost any part of the brain can cause excess excitability of local brain areas, as we discuss shortly. These local brain areas also sometimes transmit signals into the activating systems of the brain to elicit tonic-clonic seizures.",
          "What Stops the Generalized Tonic-Clonic Attack? The extreme neuronal overactivity during a tonic-clonic attack is presumed to be caused by massive simultaneous activa- tion of many reverberating neuronal pathways throughout the brain. Although the factors that terminate the attack are not well understood, it is likely that active inhibition oc- curs by inhibitory neurons that have been activated by the attack."

          "Absence seizures, formerly called petit mal seizures, usu- ally begin in childhood or early adolescence and account for 15% to 20% of epilepsy cases in children. Absence sei- zures almost certainly involve the thalamocortical brain activating system. They are usually characterized by 3 to 30 seconds of unconsciousness or diminished consciousness, during which time the person often stares and has twitch- like contractions of muscles, usually in the head region, especially blinking of the eyes; this phase is followed by a rapid return of consciousness and resumption of previous activities. The total sequence is called the absence syndrome or absence epilepsy.",
          "The patient may have one such attack in many months or, in rare cases, may have a rapid series of attacks, one after the other. The usual course is for the absence seizures to appear first during childhood or adolescence and then to disappear by the age of 30 years. On occasion, an absence seizure will initiate a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) attack.",
          "The brain wave pattern in a person with absence seizure epilepsy is demonstrated by the middle recording of Figure 60-6, which is typified by a spike and dome pattern. The spike and dome can be recorded over most or all of the cerebral cortex, showing that the seizure involves much or most of the thalamocortical activating system of the brain. In fact, animal studies suggest that it results from oscilla- tion of (1) inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons (which are inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]-producing neurons) and (2) excitatory thalamocortical and cortico- thalamic neurons."

Some of the major effects of various antiepileptic drugs include the following: (1) blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels (e.g., carbamazepine and phenytoin); (2) altered calcium cur- rents (e.g., ethosuximide); (3) an increase in GABA activity (e.g., phenobarbital and benzodiazepines); (4) inhibition of receptors for glutamate, the most prevalent excitatory neu- rotransmitter (e.g., perampanel); and (5) multiple mecha- nisms of action (e.g., valproate and topiramate, which block voltage-dependent sodium channels and increase GABA levels in the brain). The choice of antiepileptic drug rec- ommended by current guidelines depends on the type of seizure, the age of the patient, and other factors, but cor- rection of the underlying cause of the seizures is the best option when possible.",

However, when the epilepsy is medically in- tractable and does not respond to treatments, the EEG can sometimes be used to localize abnormal spiking waves origi- nating in areas of organic brain disease that predispose to focal epileptic attacks. Once such a focal point is found, sur- gical excision of the focus frequently prevents future attacks."

(New evidence has implicated still other neurotransmit- ters.) Depressed patients experience symptoms of grief, unhappiness, despair, and misery. In addition, they often lose their appetite and sex drive and have severe insomnia. Often associated with these symptoms is a state of psycho- motor agitation despite the depression.",
          "Moderate numbers of norepinephrine-secreting neurons are located in the brain stem, especially in the locus ceruleus. These neurons send fibers upward to most parts of the brain limbic system, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Also, many serotonin-producing neurons located in the midline raphe nuclei of the lower pons and medulla send fibers to many ar- eas of the limbic system and to some other areas of the brain.",
          "A principal reason for believing that depression might be caused by diminished activity of norepinephrine- and serotonin-secreting neurons is that drugs that block se- cretion of norepinephrine and serotonin, such as reser- pine, frequently cause depression. Conversely, about 70% of depressive patients can be treated effectively with drugs that increase the excitatory effects of norepinephrine and serotonin at the nerve endings, for example, as follows: (1) monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which block destruction of norepinephrine and serotonin once they are formed, and (2) tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine and ami- triptyline, which block reuptake of norepinephrine and ser- otonin by nerve endings so that these transmitters remain active for longer periods after secretion.",

Drugs that diminish the formation or action of norepinephrine and serotonin, such as lithium compounds, can be effective in treating the manic phase of the condition.",
          "It is presumed that the norepinephrine and serotonin systems normally provide drive to the limbic areas of the brain to increase a person’s sense of well-being and to cre- ate happiness, contentment, good appetite, appropriate sex drive, and psychomotor balance—although too much of a good thing can cause mania. In support of this concept is the fact that pleasure and reward centers of the hypothala- mus and surrounding areas receive large numbers of nerve endings from the norepinephrine and serotonin systems."

They may de- velop incoherent speech, dissociation of ideas, and abnor- mal sequences of thought, and they are often withdrawn, sometimes with abnormal posture and even rigidity.",
          "There are reasons to believe that schizophrenia results from one or more of three possibilities: (1) multiple areas in the cerebral cortex prefrontal lobes in which neural signals have become blocked or where processing of the signals be- comes dysfunctional because many synapses normally excit- ed by the neurotransmitter glutamate lose their responsive- ness to this transmitter; (2) excessive excitement of a group of neurons that secrete dopamine in the behavioral centers of the brain, including in the frontal lobes; and/or (3) abnormal function of a crucial part of the brain's limbic behavioral con- trol system centered around the hippocampus.",

This drug releases dopamine in the brain, which is advantageous for treating Parkinson's dis- ease, but at the same time it depresses various portions of the prefrontal lobes and other related areas.",
          "It has been suggested that in persons with schizophre- nia, excess dopamine is secreted by a group of dopamine- secreting neurons whose cell bodies lie in the ventral teg- mentum of the mesencephalon, medial and superior to the substantia nigra. These neurons give rise to the so-called mesolimbic dopaminergic system that projects nerve fibers and dopamine secretion into the medial and anterior por- tions of the limbic system, especially into the hippocam- pus, amygdala, anterior caudate nucleus, and portions of the prefrontal lobes. All these areas are powerful behavioral control centers.",
          "An even more compelling reason for believing that schizophrenia might be caused by excess production of dopamine is that many drugs that are effective in treating schizophrenia, such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and thiothixene, all either decrease secretion of dopamine at dopaminergic nerve endings or decrease the effect of do- pamine on neurons.",

Pathologically, one finds increased amounts of beta-amyloid peptide in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The peptide accumulates in amyloid plaques, which range in diameter from 10 mi- crometers to several hundred micrometers and are found in widespread areas of the brain, including in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and even the cerebellum. Thus, Alzheimer's disease appears to be a metabolic degenerative disease.",
          "A key role for excess accumulation of beta-amyloid pep- tide in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is suggested by the following observations: (1) all currently known mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease increase the production of beta-amyloid peptide; (2) patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have three copies of the gene for amyloid precur- sor protein and develop neurological characteristics of Alz- heimer's disease by midlife; (3) patients who have abnormality of a gene that controls apolipoprotein E, a blood protein that transports cholesterol to the tissues, have accelerated deposi- tion of amyloid and greatly increased risk for Alzheimer's dis- ease; (4) transgenic mice that overproduce the human amyloid precursor protein have learning and memory deficits in as- sociation with the accumulation of amyloid plaques; and (5) generation of anti-amyloid antibodies in humans with Alzhei- mer's disease appears to attenuate the disease process.",
          "Vascular Disorders May Contribute to Progression of Alzheimer's Disease. There is also accumulating evidence that cerebrovascular disease caused by hypertension and atherosclerosis may play a key role in dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrovascular disease is the second most common cause of acquired cognitive impair- ment and dementia and likely contributes to cognitive de- cline in persons with Alzheimer's disease. In fact, many of the common risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, are also rec- ognized to greatly increase the risk for developing dementia and progression of Alzheimer's disease. About 10% to 20% of brains from individuals with dementia show evidence of vascular dementia alone. In older individuals with Alzhei- mer’s disease, vascular disease is common with about 50% of patients having pathologic evidence of “silent strokes” —small brain infarcts that cause no readily apparent symptoms but could contribute to cognitive impairment."

At the other extreme, the arte- rial pressure can be decreased low enough within 10 to 15 seconds to cause fainting.

About 75% of all parasympathetic nerve fib- ers are in the vagus nerves (cranial nerve X), passing to the entire thoracic and abdominal regions of the body.

This loca- tion of the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the visceral organ is quite different from the arrangement of the sympathetic ganglia because the cell bodies of the sympathetic postganglionic neurons are almost always lo- cated in the ganglia of the sympathetic chain or in various other discrete ganglia in the abdomen, rather than in the excited organ."

A few of the postgan- glionic autonomic nerve endings, especially those of the parasympathetic nerves, are similar to but much smaller than those of the skeletal neuromuscular junction. However, many of the parasympathetic nerve fibers and almost all the sympathetic fibers merely touch the effector cells of the or- gans that they innervate as they pass by, or in some cases, they terminate in connective tissue located adjacent to the cells that are to be stimulated. Where these filaments touch or pass over or near the cells to be stimulated, they usually have bulbous enlargements called varicosities (see Figure 61-4). It is in these varicosities that the transmitter vesicles of acetylcholine or norepinephrine are synthesized and stored. Also in the varicosities are large numbers of mitochondria that supply adenosine triphosphate, which is required to en- ergize acetylcholine or norepinephrine synthesis.",
          "When an action potential spreads over the terminal fibers, the depolarization process increases the perme- ability of the fiber membrane to calcium ions, allowing these ions to diffuse into the nerve terminals or nerve var- icosities. The calcium ions in turn cause the terminals or varicosities to empty their contents to the exterior. Thus, the transmitter substance is secreted.",
          "Synthesis of Acetylcholine, Its Destruction After Secretion, and Its Duration of Action. Acetylcholine is synthesized in the terminal endings and varicosities of the cholinergic nerve fibers, where it is stored in vesicles in highly concentrated form until it is released. The basic chemical re- action of this synthesis is the following (CoA = coenzyme A): \n Acetyl-CoA + Choline —>  acetylcholine",
          "Once acetylcholine is secreted into a tissue by a cholin- ergic nerve ending, it persists in the tissue for a few seconds while it performs its nerve signal transmitter function. Then it is split into an acetate ion and choline, catalyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is bound with col- lagen and glycosaminoglycans in the local connective tis- sue. This mechanism is the same as that for acetylcholine signal transmission and subsequent acetylcholine destruc- tion that occurs at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal nerve fibers. The choline that is formed is then transported back into the terminal nerve ending, where it is used again and again for synthesis of new acetylcholine.",
          "Synthesis of Norepinephrine, Its Removal, and Its Duration of Action. Synthesis of norepinephrine begins in the axoplasm of the terminal nerve endings of adren- ergic nerve fibers but is completed inside the secretory vesicles. The basic steps are the following:  \n 1. Tyrosine —————> Dopa \n 2. Dopa ————> Dopamine \n 3. Transport of dopamine into the vesicles \n 4. Dopamine ————> Norepinephrine \n In the adrenal mtexedulla, this reaction goes still one step further to transform about 80% of the norepinephrine into epinephrine, as follows: \n 5. Norapinephrine ————> Epinephrine",
          "After secretion of norepinephrine by the terminal nerve endings, it is removed from the secretory site in three ways: (1) reuptake into the adrenergic nerve endings by an active transport process, accounting for removal of 50% to 80% of the secreted norepinephrine; (2) diffusion away from the nerve endings into the surrounding body fluids and then into the blood, accounting for removal of most of the remaining norepinephrine; and (3) destruc- tion of small amounts by tissue enzymes. One of these enzymes is monoamine oxidase, which is found in the nerve endings, and another is catechol-O-methyl transfer- ase, which is present diffusely in the tissues.",
          "Ordinarily, the norepinephrine secreted directly into a tissue remains active for only a few seconds, demonstrat- ing that its reuptake and diffusion away from the tissue are rapid. However, the norepinephrine and epinephrine secreted into the blood by the adrenal medullae remain active until they diffuse into some tissue, where they can be destroyed by catechol-O-methy] transferase; this action occurs mainly in the liver. Therefore, when secreted into the blood, both norepinephrine and epinephrine remain active for 10 to 30 seconds, but their activity declines to extinction over 1 minute to several minutes."

In turn, the altered protein molecule excites or inhibits the cell, most often by (1) causing a change in cell membrane perme- ability to one or more ions or (2) activating or inactivating an enzyme attached to the other end of the receptor protein, where it protrudes into the interior of the cell.",
          "Excitation or Inhibition of the Effector Cell by Chang- ing Its Membrane Permeability. Because the receptor protein is an integral part of the cell membrane, a confor- mational change in structure of the receptor protein often opens or closes an ion channel through the interstices of the protein molecule, thus altering the permeability of the cell membrane to various ions. For example, sodium and/ or calcium ion channels frequently become opened and allow rapid influx of the respective ions into the cell, usu- ally depolarizing the cell membrane and exciting the cell. At other times, potassium channels are opened, allowing potassium ions to diffuse out of the cell, which usually inhibits the cell because loss of electropositive potassium ions creates hypernegativity inside the cell. In some cells, the changed intracellular ion environment will cause an internal cell action, such as a direct effect of calcium ions to promote smooth muscle contraction.",
          "Receptor Action by Altering Intracellular “Second Messenger” Enzymes. Another way a receptor often functions is to activate or inactivate an enzyme (or other intracellular chemical) inside the cell. The enzyme often is attached to the receptor protein where the receptor protrudes into the interior of the cell. For example, bind- ing of norepinephrine with its receptor on the outside of many cells increases the activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase on the inside of the cell, which causes formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP in turn can initiate any one of many different intracellular actions, with the exact effect depending on the specific effector cell and its chemical machinery.",
          "It is easy to understand how an autonomic transmitter substance can cause inhibition in some organs or excita- tion in others. This is usually determined by the nature of the receptor protein in the cell membrane and the effect of receptor binding on its conformational state. In each organ, the resulting effects are likely to be different from those in other organs."

Acetylcholine activates both of them.",

The beta recep- tors are divided into beta,, beta, and beta; receptors because certain chemicals affect only certain beta recep- tors. The beta receptors also use G proteins for signaling.",
          "Norepinephrine and epinephrine, both of which are secreted into the blood by the adrenal medulla, have slightly different effects in exciting the alpha and beta receptors. Norepinephrine excites mainly alpha receptors but excites the beta receptors to a lesser extent as well. Epinephrine excites both types of receptors approximately equally. Therefore, the relative effects of norepinephrine and epi- nephrine on different effector organs are determined by the types of receptors in the organs. If they are all beta recep- tors, epinephrine will be the more effective excitant.",
          "Table 61-1 lists the distribution of alpha and beta recep- tors in some of the organs and systems controlled by the sympathetic nerves.

There- fore, alpha and beta receptors are not necessarily associated with excitation or inhibition but simply with the affinity of the hormone for the receptors in the given effector organ.",

Some of these compounds selectively activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. For example, a synthetic drug chemically similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine, iso- prenaline (isoproterenol), has an extremely strong action on beta receptors but essentially no action on alpha receptors."

Con- versely, the sympathetics become stimulated during periods of excitement and increase pupillary opening at these times.",
          "Focusing of the lens is controlled almost entirely by the par- asympathetic nervous system. The lens is normally held in a flattened state by intrinsic elastic tension of its radial ligaments. Parasympathetic excitation contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a ringlike body of smooth muscle fibers that encircles the outside ends of the lens radial ligaments. This contraction re- leases the tension on the ligaments and allows the lens to be- come more convex, causing the eye to focus on objects near at hand. The detailed focusing mechanism is discussed in Chap- ters 50 and 52 in relation to function of the eyes.",
          "Glands of the Body. The vasal, lacrimal, salivary, and many gastrointestinal glands are strongly stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system, usually resulting in copi- ous quantities of watery secretion. The glands of the alimen- tary tract most strongly stimulated by the parasympathetics are those of the upper tract, especially those of the mouth and stomach. On the other hand, the glands of the small and large intestines are controlled principally by local factors in the intestinal tract and by the intestinal enteric nervous sys- tem; they are controlled much less by the autonomic nerves.",
          "Sympathetic stimulation has a direct effect on most ali- mentary gland cells to cause formation of a concentrated secretion that contains high percentages of enzymes and mucus. However, it also causes vasoconstriction of the blood vessels that supply the glands and in this way some- times reduces their rates of secretion.",
          "The sweat glands secrete large quantities of sweat when the sympathetic nerves are stimulated, but no effect is caused by stimulating the parasympathetic nerves. How- ever, the sympathetic fibers to most sweat glands are cho- linergic (except for a few adrenergic fibers to the palms and soles), in contrast to almost all other sympathetic fibers, which are adrenergic. Furthermore, the sweat glands are stimulated primarily by centers in the hypothalamus that are usually considered to be parasympathetic centers. Therefore, sweating could be called a parasympathetic function, even though it is controlled by nerve fibers that anatomically are distributed through the sympathetic nerv- ous system.",
          "The apocrine glands in the axillae secrete a thick, odor- iferous secretion as a result of sympathetic stimulation, but they do not respond to parasympathetic stimulation. This secretion actually functions as a lubricant to allow easy sliding motion of the inside surfaces under the shoulder joint. The apocrine glands, despite their close embryologi- cal relation to sweat glands, are activated by adrenergic fib- ers rather than by cholinergic fibers and are also controlled by the sympathetic centers of the central nervous system rather than by the parasympathetic centers.",

The gastrointestinal system has its own intrinsic set of nerves known as the intramural plexus or the intestinal enteric nerv- ous system, located in the walls of the gut. Also, both para- sympathetic and sympathetic stimulation originating in the brain can affect gastrointestinal activity mainly by increasing or decreasing specific actions in the gastrointestinal intramu- ral plexus. Parasympathetic stimulation, in general, increases the overall activity of the gastrointestinal tract by promoting peristalsis and relaxing the sphincters, thus allowing rapid propulsion of contents along the tract. This propulsive effect is associated with simultaneous increases in rates of secre- tion by many of the gastrointestinal glands, described earlier.",
          "Normal motility functions of the gastrointestinal tract are not very dependent on sympathetic stimulation. How- ever, strong sympathetic stimulation inhibits peristalsis and increases the tone of the sphincters. The net result is greatly slowed propulsion of food through the tract and sometimes decreased secretion as well—even to the extent of some- times causing constipation.",

          "Parasympathetic stimulation causes mainly opposite ef- fects—decreased heart rate and strength of contraction. To express these effects in another way, sympathetic stimula- tion increases the effectiveness of the heart as a pump, as required during heavy exercise, whereas parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart pumping, allowing the heart to rest between bouts of strenuous activity.",
          "Systemic Blood Vessels. Most systemic blood vessels, especially those of the abdominal viscera and skin of the limbs, are constricted by sympathetic stimulation. Para- sympathetic stimulation has almost no effects on most blood vessels. Under some conditions, the beta adrenergic function of the sympathetics causes vascular dilation in- stead of the usual vascular constriction; however, this di- lation occurs rarely except after drugs have paralyzed the sympathetic alpha vasoconstrictor effects which, in most blood vessels, are usually far dominant over the beta effects.",
          "Effect of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Stimulation on Arterial Pressure. The arterial pressure is determined by two factors, propulsion of blood by the heart and resist- ance to flow of blood through the peripheral blood vessels. Sympathetic stimulation increases both propulsion by the heart and resistance to flow, which usually causes a marked acute increase in arterial pressure but often very little change in long-term pressure unless the sympathetics also stimulate the kidneys to retain salt and water at the same time.",
          "Conversely, moderate parasympathetic stimulation via the vagal nerves decreases pumping by the heart but has virtually no effect on vascular peripheral resistance. There- fore, the usual effect is a slight decrease in arterial pressure.

Because of the great importance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic con- trol systems, they are discussed many times in this text in relation to multiple body functions. In general, most of the entodermal structures, such as the ducts of the liver, gall- bladder, ureter, urinary bladder, and bronchi, are inhibited by sympathetic stimulation but excited by parasympathetic stimulation. Sympathetic stimulation also has multiple metabolic effects such as release of glucose from the liver and an increase in blood glucose concentration, glycogen- olysis in liver and muscle, skeletal muscle strength, basal metabolic rate, and mental activity. Finally, the sympathet- ics and parasympathetics are involved in execution of the male and female sexual acts, as explained in Chapters 81 and 82."

On average, about 80% of the secre- tion is epinephrine and 20% is norepinephrine, although the relative proportions can change considerably under different physiological conditions.",
          "The circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine have almost the same effects on the different organs as the effects caused by direct sympathetic stimulation, except that the effects last 5 to 10 times as long because both of these hormones are removed from the blood slowly over a period of 2 to 4 minutes.",

          "Epinephrine causes almost the same effects as those caused by norepinephrine, but the effects differ in the fol- lowing respects. First, epinephrine, because of its greater effect in stimulating the beta receptors, has a greater effect on cardiac stimulation than does norepinephrine. Second, epinephrine causes only weak constriction of the blood vessels in the muscles, in comparison with much stron- ger constriction caused by norepinephrine. Because the muscle vessels represent a major segment of the vessels of the body, this difference is of special importance because norepinephrine greatly increases the total peripheral resistance and elevates arterial pressure, whereas epi- nephrine raises the arterial pressure to a lesser extent but increases the cardiac output more.",
          "A third difference between the actions of epineph- rine and norepinephrine relates to their effects on tissue metabolism. Epinephrine has 5 to 10 times greater meta- bolic effect as does norepinephrine. Indeed, the epineph- rine secreted by the adrenal medullae can increase the metabolic rate of the whole body as much as 100% above normal, in this way increasing the activity and excitability of the body. It also increases the rates of other metabolic activities, such as glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle and glucose release into the blood.",
          "In summary, stimulation of the adrenal medullae causes release of the hormones epinephrine and norepi- nephrine, which together have almost the same effects throughout the body as direct sympathetic stimulation, except that the effects are more prolonged, lasting 2 to 4 minutes after the stimulation is over.",
          "The Adrenal Medullae Support Sympathetic Nerv- ous System Functions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are almost always released by the adrenal medullae at the same time that the different organs are stimulated directly by generalized sympathetic activation. Therefore, the or- gans are actually stimulated in two ways—directly by the sympathetic nerves and indirectly by the adrenal medul- lary hormones. The two means of stimulation support each other and either can, in most cases, substitute for the other. For example, destruction of the direct sympathetic pathways to the different body organs does not abrogate sympathetic excitation of the organs because norepineph- rine and epinephrine are still released into the circulating blood and indirectly cause stimulation. Likewise, loss of the two adrenal medullae usually has little effect on the operation of the sympathetic nervous system because the direct pathways can still perform almost all the necessary duties. Thus, the dual mechanism of sympathetic stimula- tion provides a safety factor, with one mechanism substi- tuting for the other if it is missing.",
          "Another important value of the adrenal medullae is the capability of epinephrine and norepinephrine to stimulate structures of the body that are not innervated by direct sympathetic fibers. For example, the metabolic rate of almost every cell of the body is increased by these hormones, especially by epinephrine, even though only a small proportion of all the cells in the body are innervated directly by sympathetic fibers."

The value of tone is that it allows a single nervous system to both increase and decrease the activity of a stimulated organ. For example, sympathetic tone nor- mally keeps almost all the systemic arterioles constricted to about one-half their maximum diameter. By increas- ing the degree of sympathetic stimulation above normal, these vessels can be constricted even more; conversely, by decreasing the stimulation below normal, the arterioles can be dilated. Thus, the sympathetic system can cause vasoconstriction or vasodilation by increasing or decreas- ing its activity, respectively.",
          "Another interesting example of tone is the background “tone” of the parasympathetics in the gastrointestinal tract. Surgical removal of the parasympathetic supply to most of the gut by cutting the vagus nerves can cause serious and prolonged gastric and intestinal “atony” with resulting blockage of much of the normal gastrointesti- nal propulsion and consequent serious constipation, thus demonstrating that parasympathetic tone to the gut is normally very much required. This tone can be decreased by the brain, thereby inhibiting gastrointestinal motility, or it can be increased, thereby promoting increased gas- trointestinal activity.",
          "Tone Caused by Basal Secretion of Epinephrine and Norepinephrine by the Adrenal Medullae. The normal resting rate of secretion by the adrenal medullae is about 0.2 ug/kg/min of epinephrine and about 0.05 yg/kg/min of norepinephrine. These quantities are enough to main- tain the blood pressure almost normal even if all direct sympathetic pathways to the cardiovascular system are removed. Therefore, it is obvious that much of the overall tone of the sympathetic nervous system results from basal secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine in addition to the tone resulting from direct sympathetic stimulation.",
          "Effect of Loss of Sympathetic or Parasympathetic Tone After Denervation. Immediately after a sympa- thetic or parasympathetic nerve is cut, the innervated organ loses its sympathetic or parasympathetic tone. In many blood vessels, for example, cutting the sympa- thetic nerves results in substantial vasodilation within 5 to 30 seconds. However, over minutes, hours, days, or weeks, intrinsic tone in the smooth muscle of the vessels increases—that is, increased tone caused by increased smooth muscle contractile force that is not the result of sympathetic stimulation but of chemical adaptations in the smooth muscle fibers, including increased sensitiv- ity to the effects of circulating catecholamines secreted by the adrenal medullae. This intrinsic tone and increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines eventually re- store almost normal vasoconstriction.",
          "Essentially the same effects occur in most other effec- tor organs whenever sympathetic or parasympathetic tone is lost. That is, intrinsic compensation soon develops to return the function of the organ almost to its normal basal level. However, in the parasympathetic system, the compensation sometimes requires many months. For example, loss of parasympathetic tone to the heart after cardiac vagotomy increases the heart rate to 160 beats/ min in a dog, and this rate will still be partially elevated 6 months later. Likewise, loss of parasympathetic tone to the gastrointestinal system has long lasting effects on the gut."

This effect is demonstrated in Figure 61-5, which shows that blood flow in the forearm before removal of the sympathetics is about 200 ml/min; a test dose of nor- epinephrine causes only a slight depression in flow lasting a minute or so. Then the stellate ganglion is removed, and normal sympathetic tone is lost. At first, the blood flow rises markedly because of the lost vascular tone, but over a period of days to weeks the blood flow returns much of the way back toward normal because of a progressive increase in the intrinsic tone of the vascular musculature itself, thus partially compensating for the loss of sympathetic tone. Then, another test dose of norepinephrine is administered, and the blood flow decreases much more than before, dem- onstrating that the blood vessels have become about two to four times as responsive to norepinephrine as previously. This phenomenon is called denervation supersensitivity. It occurs in both sympathetic and parasympathetic organs but to a far greater extent in some organs than in others, occasionally increasing the response more than 10-fold.",
          "Mechanism of Denervation Supersensitivity. The cause of denervation supersensitivity is only partially known. Part of the answer is that the number of receptors in the post- synaptic membranes of the effector cells increases—some- times many times—when norepinephrine or acetylcholine is no longer released at the synapses, a process called “up- regulation” of the receptors. Therefore, when a dose of the hormone is now injected into the circulating blood, the ef- fector reaction is vastly enhanced."

One of these reflexes is the barore- ceptor reflex, which is described in Chapter 18 along with other cardiovascular reflexes. Briefly, stretch receptors called baroreceptors are located in the walls of several ma- jor arteries, including especially the internal carotid arter- ies and the arch of the aorta. When these become stretched by high pressure, signals are transmitted to the brain stem, where they inhibit the sympathetic impulses to the heart and blood vessels and excite the parasympathetics; this al- lows the arterial pressure to fall back toward normal.",

For example, the smell of appetizing food or the presence of food in the mouth initiates signals from the nose and mouth to the vagal, glossopharyngeal, and salivatory nuclei of the brain stem. These nuclei in turn transmit signals through the par- asympathetic nerves to the secretory glands of the mouth and stomach, causing secretion of digestive juices some- times even before food enters the mouth.",

          "Other Autonomic Reflexes. Emptying of the urinary bladder is controlled in the same way as emptying of the rectum; stretching of the bladder sends impulses to the sacral cord, which in turn causes reflex contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the urinary sphincters, thereby promoting micturition.",

Many “local reflexes” involving sensory afferent fib- ers travel centrally in the peripheral nerves to the sympathetic ganglia and spinal cord and cause high- ly localized reflex responses. For example, heating a skin area causes local vasodilation and enhanced local sweating, whereas cooling causes opposite ef- fects. \n 3. Many of the sympathetic reflexes that control gas- trointestinal functions operate by way of nerve pathways that do not even enter the spinal cord, merely passing from the gut mainly to the para- vertebral ganglia, and then back to the gut through sympathetic nerves to control motor or secretory activity.",

For example, parasympathetic cardiovascular reflexes usually act on the heart only to increase or decrease its rate of beating with little direct effect on its force of contraction. Likewise, other parasympathetic reflexes cause secretion mainly by the mouth glands, and in other cases, secre- tion is mainly by the stomach glands.

Control of each of these is discussed at appropriate points in this text. Some of the most important factors controlled in the brain stem are arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.

For example, stimulation in appropriate areas—mainly of the posterior hypothalamus—can activate the medullary cardiovascular control centers strongly enough to increase arterial pressure to more than twice normal. Likewise, other hypothalamic centers control body temperature, increase or decrease salivation and gas- trointestinal activity, and cause bladder emptying. To some extent, the autonomic centers in the brain stem act as relay stations for control activities initiated at higher levels of the brain, especially in the hypothala- mus.",
          "In Chapters 59 and 60, we pointed out also that many of our behavioral responses are mediated through the following: (1) the hypothalamus, (2) the reticular areas of the brain stem, and (3) the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, some higher areas of the brain can alter function of the whole autonomic nervous system or of portions of it strongly enough to cause severe autonomic-induced disease such as peptic ulcer of the stomach or duode- num, constipation, heart palpitation, or even heart attack."

From the foregoing discussion, it is obvious that intravenous injection of norepinephrine causes essentially the same effects throughout the body as sympathetic stimulation. Therefore, norepinephrine is called a sympathomimetic or adrenergic drug. Epinephrine and methoxamine are also sympathomi- metic drugs, and there are many others. They differ from one another in the degree to which they stimulate different recep- tors in sympathetic effector organs and in their duration of ac- tion. Norepinephrine and epinephrine have actions as short as 1 to 2 minutes, whereas the actions of some other commonly used sympathomimetic drugs last for 30 minutes to 2 hours.",

The released norepinephrine in turn causes the sympathetic effects.",
          "Drugs That Block Adrenergic Activity. Adrenergic activity can be blocked at several points in the stimulatory rocess, as follows: \n 1. The synthesis and storage of norepinephrine in the sympathetic nerve endings can be prevented. The best- known drug that causes this effect is reserpine. \n 2. Release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic end- ings can be blocked. This effect can be caused by gua- nethidine. \n 3. The sympathetic alpha receptors can be blocked. Two rugs that block both alpha, and alpha, adrenergic receptors are phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. Se- lective alpha, adrenergic blockers include prazosin and terazosin, whereas yohimbine blocks alpha, receptors. \n 4. The sympathetic beta receptors can be blocked. A drug that blocks both beta; and beta, receptors is proprano- Jol. Drugs that block mainly beta; receptors are atenolol, nebivolol, and metoprolol. \n 5. Sympathetic activity can be blocked by drugs that block transmission of nerve impulses through the autonomic ganglia. They are discussed in a later section, but drugs that block both sympathetic and parasympathetic trans- mission through the ganglia include hexamethonium and pentolinium."

For example, total cessation of blood flow to the brain causes unconsciousness within 5 to 10 seconds because lack of oxygen (O,) delivery to the brain cells nearly shuts down metabolism in these cells.

          "As in most other tissues, cerebral blood flow is highly related to the tissue metabolism. Several metabolic fac- tors are believed to contribute to cerebral blood flow regulation: (1) CO2, concentration; (2) hydrogen ion (H+) concentration; (3) O2, concentration; and (4) sub- stances released from astrocytes, which are specialized, non-neuronal cells that appear to couple neuronal activity with local blood flow regulation (see Figure 62-1).",
          "Excesses of CO2, or H+ Concentration Increase Cerebral Blood Flow. An increase in CO2, concentration in the arterial blood perfusing the brain greatly increases cerebral blood flow. This is demonstrated in Figure 62-2, which shows that a 70% increase in arterial partial pres- sure of CO2, (Pco2,) approximately doubles cerebral blood flow.",

          "Importance of Cerebral Blood Flow Control by CO2, and H+. Increased H+ concentration greatly depresses neuronal activity. Therefore, it is fortunate that increased H+ concentration also elicits increased blood flow, which in turn carries H+, COy, and other acid-forming substanc- es away from the brain tissues. Loss of CO) removes car- bonic acid from the tissues; this action, along with removal of other acids, reduces the Ht concentration back toward normal. Thus, this mechanism helps maintain a constant H+ concentration in the cerebral fluids and thereby helps to maintain a normal, constant level of neuronal activity.",

Except during periods of intense brain activity, the rate of O2, utilization by the brain tissue remains within narrow limits—almost exactly 3.5 (+0.2) ml of O2/100 g of brain tissue/min. If brain blood flow becomes insufficient to supply adequate O», the O2, deficiency almost immedi- ately causes vasodilation, returning the brain blood flow and transport of O2, to the cerebral tissues to near normal. Thus, this local blood flow regulatory mechanism is al- most exactly the same in the brain as in coronary blood vessels, in skeletal muscle, and in most other circulatory areas of the body.",
          "Experiments have shown that a decrease in cerebral tissue partial pressure of O» (P02) below about 30 mm Hg (the normal value is 35-40 mm Hg) immediately begins to increase cerebral blood flow. This is fortuitous because brain function becomes deranged at lower values of Po», especially at Po, levels below 20 mm Hg. Even coma can result at these low levels. Thus, the O2 mechanism for local regulation of cerebral blood flow is an important protective response against diminished cerebral neuro- nal activity and, therefore, against derangement of mental capability.",
          "Substances Released From Astrocytes Regulate Cer- ebral Blood Flow. Increasing evidence suggests that the close coupling between neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow is due, in part, to substances released from as- trocytes (also called astroglial cells) that surround blood vessels of the central nervous system. Astrocytes are star- shaped non-neuronal cells that support and protect neu- rons, as well as provide nutrition. They have numerous projections that make contact with neurons and the sur- rounding blood vessels, providing a potential mechanism for neurovascular communication. Gray matter astrocytes (protoplasmic astrocytes) extend fine processes that cover most synapses and large foot processes that are closely ap- posed to the vascular wall (see Figure 62-1).",
          "Experimental studies have shown that electrical stimula- tion of excitatory glutaminergic neurons leads to increased intracellular calcium ion concentration in astrocyte foot processes and vasodilation of nearby arterioles. Additional studies have suggested that the vasodilation is mediated by several vasoactive metabolites released from astrocytes. Al- though the precise mediators are still unclear, nitric oxide, metabolites of arachidonic acid, potassium ions, adenosine, and other substances generated by astrocytes in response to stimulation of adjacent excitatory neurons have all been suggested to be important in mediating local vasodilation.",
          "Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow and Effect of Brain Activity on Flow. A method has been developed to record blood flow in as many as 256 isolated segments of the human cerebral cortex simultaneously. To record blood flow in these segments, a radioactive substance, such as radioactive xenon (Xe), is injected into the carotid ar- tery; then the radioactivity of each segment of the cortex is recorded as the radioactive substance passes through the brain tissue. For this purpose, 256 small radioactive scintil- lation detectors are pressed against the surface of the cor- tex. The rapidity of rise and decay of radioactivity in each tissue segment is a direct measure of the rate of blood flow through that segment.",
          "Using this technique, it has become clear that blood flow in each individual segment of the brain changes as much as 100% to 150% within seconds in response to changes in local neuronal activity. For example, simply clenching the hand into a fist causes an immediate increase in blood flow in the motor cortex of the opposite side of the brain. Read- ing a book increases the blood flow, especially in the visual areas of the occipital cortex and in the language perception areas of the temporal cortex. This measuring procedure can also be used for localizing the origin of epileptic attacks be- cause local brain blood flow increases acutely and markedly at the focal point of each attack.",

          "Blood flow and neural activity in different regions of the brain can also be assessed indirectly by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method is based on the observation that oxygen-rich hemoglobin (oxyhemoglobin)  and oxygen-poor hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) in the blood behave differently in a magnetic field. Deoxyhemoglobin is a paramagnetic molecule (i.e., attracted by an externally applied magnetic field), whereas oxyhemoglobin is diamagnetic (i.e., repelled by a magnetic field). The presence of deoxyhemoglobin in a blood vessel causes a measurable difference of the magnetic resonance (MR) proton  signal of the vessel and its surrounding tissue. The blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signals obtained from fMRI,  however, depend on the total amount of deoxyhemoglobin  in the specific three-dimensional space (voxel) of brain tissue being assessed. This, in turn, is influenced by the rate of  blood flow, volume of blood, and rate of O2 consumption  in the specific voxel of brain tissue. For this reason, BOLD  fMRI provides only an indirect estimate of regional blood flow, although it can also be used to produce maps showing which parts of the brain are activated in a particular mental process.",
          "An alternative MRI method called arterial spin labeling (ASL) can be used to provide a more quantitative assessment of regional blood flow. ASL works by manipulating the MR signal of arterial blood before it is delivered  to different areas of the brain. By subtracting two images in which the arterial blood is manipulated differently, the static proton signal in the rest of the tissue subtracts out, leaving only the signal arising from the delivered arterial blood. ASL and BOLD imaging can be used together simultaneously to provide a probe of regional brain blood flow and neuronal function.",
          "Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation Protects the Brain From Changes in Arterial Pressure. During normal daily activities, arterial pressure can fluctuate widely, rising to high levels during states of excitement or strenuous activity and falling to low levels during sleep. However, cerebral blood flow is “autoregulated” extremely well between arterial pressure limits of approximately 60 and 150 mm Hg (Figure 62-4). That is, acute reductions in mean arterial pressure to as low as 60 mm Hg or increases to as high as 150 mm Hg do not cause major changes in cerebral blood flow in people who have normal autoregulation.",
          "In people who have chronic hypertension there is hypertrophic emodeling of their cerebral blood vessels, as well as blood vessels in other organs (discussed in Chapter 17), and the autoregulatory curve is shifted to higher blood pressures. This resetting of cerebral blood flow autoregulation partially protects the brain from the damaging effects of the high blood pressure. but also makes the brain vulnerable to severe ischemia if blood pressure is reduced too rapidly below the range of autoregulation. If arterial pressure falls below the limits of autoregulation, cerebral blood flow becomes severely decreased.",
          "Impairment of autoregulation makes cerebral blood flow much more dependent on arterial pressure. For example, in reeclampsia, a disorder of pregnancy associated with vascular dysfunction and hypertension, cerebral blood flow autoregulation may be impaired, leading to pressuredependent increases in cerebral blood flow, disruption of the vascular endothelium, edema, and seizures in some cases. In old age, atherosclerosis and various brain disorders, cerebral blood flow autoregulation may also be impaired, increasing the risk for blood pressure–dependent injury of the brain.",
          "Role of the Sympathetic Nervous System in Controlling Cerebral lood Flow. The cerebral circulatory system has strong sympathetic innervation that passes upward from the superior cervical sympathetic ganglia in the neck and then into the brain along with the cerebral arteries. This innervation supplies both the large brain arteries and the arteries that penetrate into the substance of the brain. However, transection of the sympathetic nerves or mild to moderate stimulation of them usually causes little change in cerebral blood flow because the blood flow autoregulation mechanism can override the nervous effects.",
          "When mean arterial pressure rises acutely to an exceptionally high level, such as during strenuous exercise or during other states of excessive circulatory activity, the sympathetic nervous system normally constricts the large and intermediate-sized brain arteries enough to prevent the high pressure from reaching the smaller brain blood vessels. This mechanism is important in preventing vascular hemorrhages into the brain—that is, for preventing “cerebral stroke."

The plaques can activate the clotting mechanism of the blood, causing a blood clot to occur and block blood flow in the artery, thereby leading to acute loss of brain function in a localized area.",
          "In about 25% of people in whom strokes develop, high blood pressure makes one of the blood vessels burst; hem- orrhage then occurs, compressing the local brain tissue and further compromising its functions. The neurological ef- fects of a stroke are determined by the brain area affected. One of the most common types of stroke is blockage of the middle cerebral artery that supplies the midportion of one brain hemisphere. For example, if the middle cerebral artery is blocked on the left side of the brain, the person is likely to lose function in Wernicke’s speech comprehension area in the left cerebral hemisphere, and he or she also becomes unable to speak words because of loss of Broca’s motor area for word formation. In addition, loss of function of neural motor control areas of the left hemisphere can create spastic paralysis of most muscles on the opposite side of the body.",
          "Ina similar manner, blockage of a posterior cerebral ar- tery will cause infarction of the occipital pole of the hemi- sphere on the same side as the blockage, which causes loss of vision in both eyes in the half of the retina on the same side as the stroke lesion. Especially devastating are strokes that involve the blood supply to the midbrain because this effect can block nerve conduction in major pathways be- tween the brain and spinal cord, causing both sensory and motor abnormalities.",

On the side opposite to the area that is struck, the sudden movement of the whole skull causes the skull to pull away from the brain momentarily because of the brain’s inertia, creating for a split second a vacuum space in the cranial vault in the area opposite to the blow. Then, when the skull is no longer being accelerated by the blow, the vacuum suddenly collapses and the brain strikes the inner surface of the skull.",

Whether these lymphatic vessels are present in human beings is still uncertain."

          "The normal pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid system when one is lying in a horizontal position averages 130 mm of wa- ter (10 mm Hg), although this pressure may be as low as 65 mm of water or as high as 195 mm of water even in the normal healthy person.",
          "Regulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure by the Arachnoidal Villi. The normal rate of cerebrospinal fluid formation remains nearly constant, so changes in fluid formation are seldom a factor in pressure control. The arachnoidal villi function like valves that allow cerebro- spinal fluid and its contents to flow readily into the blood of the venous sinuses while not allowing blood to flow backward in the opposite direction. Normally, this valve action of the villi allows cerebrospinal fluid to begin to flow into the blood when cerebrospinal fluid pressure is about 1.5 mm Hg greater than the pressure of the blood in the venous sinuses. Then, if the cerebrospinal fluid pressure rises still higher, the valves open more widely. Under normal conditions, the cerebrospinal fluid pres- sure almost never rises more than a few millimeters of mercury higher than the pressure in the cerebral venous sinuses.",
          "In disease states, the villi sometimes become blocked by large particulate matter, by fibrosis, or by blood cells that have leaked into the cerebrospinal fluid in brain diseases. Such blockage can cause high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, as described in the following section.",
          "High Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure in Pathological Con- ditions of the Brain. Often a large brain tumor elevates the cerebrospinal fluid pressure by decreasing reabsorption of the cerebrospinal fluid back into the blood. As a result, the cerebrospinal fluid pressure can rise to as much as 500 mm of water (37 mm Hg) or about four times normal.",
          "The cerebrospinal fluid pressure also rises considerably when hemorrhage or infection occurs in the cranial vault. In both these conditions, large numbers of red and/or white blood cells suddenly appear in the cerebrospinal fluid and can cause serious blockage of the small absorption chan- nels through the arachnoidal villi. This also sometimes el- evates the cerebrospinal fluid pressure to 400 to 600 mm of water (about four times normal).",
          "Some babies are born with high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which is often caused by abnormally high resist- ance to fluid reabsorption through the arachnoidal villi, resulting either from too few arachnoidal villi or from villi with abnormal absorptive properties. This is discussed later in connection with hydrocephalus.",
          "Measurement of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure. The usual procedure for measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure is simple. First, the person lies exactly horizontally on his or her side so that the fluid pressure in the spinal canal is equal to the pressure in the cranial vault. A spinal needle is then inserted into the lumbar spinal canal below the lower end of the cord, and the needle is connected to a vertical glass tube that is open to the air at its top. The spinal fluid is al- lowed to rise in the tube as high as it will. If it rises to a level 136 mm above the level of the needle, the pressure is said to be 136 mm of water pressure—or, dividing this number by 13.6, which is the specific gravity of mercury, about 10 mm Hg pressure.",
          "Obstruction to Flow of Cerebrospinal Fluid Can Cause Hydrocephalus. “Hydrocephalus” means excess water in the cranial vault. This condition is frequently divided into communicating hydrocephalus and noncommunicating hy- drocephalus. In communicating hydrocephalus, fluid flows readily from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space, whereas in noncommunicating hydrocephalus, fluid flow out of one or more of the ventricles is blocked.",
          "Usually the noncommunicating type of hydrocephalus is caused by a block in the aqueduct of Sylvius, resulting from atresia (closure) before birth in many babies or from blockage by a brain tumor at any age. As fluid is formed by the choroid plexuses in the two lateral and the third ventri- cles, the volumes of these three ventricles increase greatly, which flattens the brain into a thin shell against the skull. In neonates, the increased pressure also causes the whole head to swell because the skull bones have not yet fused.",
          "The communicating type of hydrocephalus is usually caused by blockage of fluid flow in the subarachnoid spaces around the basal regions of the brain or by blockage of the arachnoidal villi where the fluid is normally absorbed into the venous sinuses. Fluid therefore collects both on the outside of the brain and to a lesser extent inside the ventri- cles. This will also cause the head to swell tremendously if it occurs in infancy when the skull is still pliable and can be stretched, and it can damage the brain at any age. A therapy for many types of hydrocephalus is surgical placement of a silicone tube shunt all the way from one of the brain ven- tricles to the peritoneal cavity where the excess fluid can be absorbed into the blood."

          "It has already been pointed out that the concentrations of several important constituents of cerebrospinal fluid are not the same as in extracellular fluid elsewhere in the body. Furthermore, many large molecules hardly pass at all from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid or into the interstitial fluids of the brain, even though these same substances pass readily into the usual interstitial fluids of the body. There- fore, it is said that barriers, called the blood—cerebrospinal fluid barrier and the blood-brain barrier, exist between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid, respec- tively.",
          "These barriers exist both at the choroid plexus and at the tissue capillary membranes in essentially all areas of the brain parenchyma except in some areas of the hypothala- mus, pineal gland, and area postrema, where substances diffuse with greater ease into the tissue spaces. The ease of diffusion in these areas is important because they have sensory receptors that respond to specific changes in the body fluids, such as changes in osmolality and in glucose concentration, as well as receptors for peptide hormones that regulate thirst, such as angiotensin II. The blood-brain barrier also has specific carrier molecules that facilitate transport of hormones, such as leptin, from the blood into the hypothalamus where they bind to specific receptors that control other functions such as appetite and sympa- thetic nervous system activity.",
          "In general, the blood—cerebrospinal fluid and blood—brain barriers are highly permeable to water, CO2, O2, and most lipid- soluble substances such as alcohol and anesthetics; slightly permeable to electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and potas- sium; and almost totally impermeable to plasma proteins and most non-lipid-soluble large organic molecules. Therefore, the blood—cerebrospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers often make it impossible to achieve effective concentrations of thera- peutic drugs, such as protein antibodies and non-lipid-soluble drugs, in the cerebrospinal fluid or parenchyma of the brain.",
          "The cause of the low permeability of the blood—cere- brospinal fluid and blood-brain barriers is the manner in which the endothelial cells of the brain tissue capillaries are joined to one another. They are joined by so-called tight junctions. That is, the membranes of the adjacent endothe- lial cells are tightly fused rather than having large slit pores between them, as is the case for most other capillaries of the body."

        "paragraphs": [
          "One of the most serious complications of abnormal cer- ebral fluid dynamics is the development of brain edema. Because the brain is encased in a solid cranial vault, ac- cumulation of extra edema fluid compresses the blood vessels, often causing seriously decreased blood flow and destruction of brain tissue.",
          "The usual cause of brain edema is either greatly in- creased capillary pressure or damage to the capillary wall that makes the wall leaky to fluid. A common cause is a serious blow to the head, leading to brain concussion, in which the brain tissues and capillaries are traumatized and capillary fluid leaks into the traumatized tissues.",
          "Once brain edema begins, it often initiates two vicious circles because of the following positive feedbacks: \n 1. Edema compresses the vasculature, which in turn lecreases blood flow and causes brain ischemia. The ischemia in turn causes arteriolar dilation with still further increase in capillary pressure. The increased capillary pressure then causes more edema fluid, so the edema becomes progressively worse. \n 2. The decreased cerebral blood flow also decreases Oy elivery, which increases the permeability of the capil- laries, allowing still more fluid leakage. The diminished blood flow also reduces delivery of substrates needed to produce adequate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that, in turn, is required for the sodium pumps of the neuronal tissue cells, thus allowing these cells to swell.",
          "Once these vicious circles have begun, heroic measures must be used to prevent total destruction of the brain. One such measure is to infuse intravenously a concentrated osmotic substance, such as a concentrated mannitol solution, whic pulls fluid by osmosis from the brain tissue and breaks up the vicious circles. Another procedure is to remove fluid quickly from the lateral ventricles of the brain by means of ventricular needle puncture, thereby relieving the intracerebral pressure."

        "paragraphs": [
          "Like other tissues, the brain requires O2, and food nutri- ents to supply its metabolic needs. However, brain metab- olism features special attributes that require mention.",
          "Total Brain Metabolic Rate and Metabolic Rate of Neurons. Under resting but awake conditions, brain me- tabolism accounts for about 15% of the total metabolism in the body, even though brain mass is only 2% of the to- tal body mass. Therefore, under resting conditions, brain metabolism per unit mass of tissue is about 7.5 times the average metabolism in non-nervous system tissues.",
          "Most of this brain metabolism occurs in the neurons, not in the glial supportive tissues. The major need for metabolism in the neurons is to pump ions through their membranes, mainly to transport sodium and calcium ions to the outside of the neuronal membrane and potassium ions to the interior. Each time a neuron conducts an action potential, these ions move through the membranes, increasing the need for additional membrane transport to restore proper ionic concentration differences across the neuron membranes. Therefore, during high levels of brain activity, neuronal metabolism can increase as much as 100% to 150%.",
          "Special Requirement of the Brain for Oxygen—Lack of Significant Anaerobic Metabolism. Most tissues of the body can live without O2, for several minutes and some for as long as 30 minutes. During this time, the tissue cells obtain their energy through processes of anaerobic metabolism, which means release of energy by partially breaking down glucose and glycogen but without combining these with O2,. This process delivers energy but at the expense of consuming tremendous amounts of glucose and glycogen. However, it does keep the tissues alive.",
          "The brain is not capable of much anaerobic metabolism after sudden reduction in O2, delivery. One of the reasons for this is the high metabolic rate of the neurons, so most neuronal activity depends on second-by-second delivery of O2, from the blood. Putting these factors together, one can understand why sudden cessation of blood flow to the brain or sudden total lack of O2, in the blood can cause unconsciousness within 5 to 10 seconds.",
          "Under Normal Conditions, Most Brain Energy Is Sup- plied by Glucose. Under normal conditions, almost all the energy used by the brain cells is supplied by glucose derived from the blood. As is true for Oz, most of this glucose is derived minute by minute and second by second from the capillary blood, with a total of only about a 2-minute supply of glucose normally stored as glycogen in the neurons at any given time.",
          "A special feature of glucose delivery to neurons is that its transport into the neurons through the cell mem- brane is not dependent on insulin, even though insulin is required for glucose transport into most other body cells. Therefore, in patients who have serious diabetes with essentially zero secretion of insulin, glucose still diffuses readily into the neurons, which is most fortu- nate in preventing loss of mental function in persons with diabetes. Yet when a diabetic patient is overtreated with insulin, the blood glucose concentration can fall to an extremely low level because the excess insulin causes almost all the glucose in the blood to be transported rapidly into the vast numbers of insulin-sensitive non- neural cells throughout the body, especially into muscle and liver cells. When this happens, not enough glucose is left in the blood to supply the neurons properly, and mental function becomes seriously deranged, lead- ing sometimes to coma and even more often to mental imbalances and psychotic disturbances—all caused by overtreatment with insulin."
